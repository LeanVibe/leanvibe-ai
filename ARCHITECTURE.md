### 4-Tier Testing Infrastructure

```yaml
Tier 0 - Pre-commit (<60s):
  Purpose: Fast developer feedback
  Includes: Unit tests, contract validation, type checking, linting
  Triggers: Pre-commit hook, IDE integration
  
Tier 1 - PR Gate (3-5min):
  Purpose: Integration validation
  Includes: Contract tests, WebSocket handshake, API smoke tests, coverage ratchet
  Triggers: Pull request creation
  
Tier 2 - Nightly (30min):

{
  "coverage_percent_min": 70.0,      # Only increases
  "mutation_score_min": 60.0,        # Only increases  
  "test_execution_time_max": 60.0,   # Only decreases
  "performance_p95_max": 500.0,      # Only decreases
  "memory_usage_mb_max": 500.0,      # Only decreases
  "flaky_test_count_max": 2,         # Only decreases
  "security_issues_max": 0,          # Must remain 0
  "technical_debt_ratio_max": 0.05   # Only decreases
