## Our Commitment to Privacy

LeenVibe is built with privacy as a core principle. We believe your development data, voice commands, and personal information should remain private and secure.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

**LeenVibe does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.** Specifically:

## On-Device Processing

All LeenVibe functionality operates entirely on your device:
