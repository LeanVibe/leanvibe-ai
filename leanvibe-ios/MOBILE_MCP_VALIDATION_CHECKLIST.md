- [ ] Settings tab comprehensive menu display
- [ ] Voice tab (if enabled) - proper voice controls

### Feature Flag Gating
- [ ] Verify Document Intelligence tab is hidden in production builds
- [ ] Confirm Code Test button is hidden in production builds
- [ ] Validate advanced settings are properly gated by environment
- [ ] Test debug features are only visible in debug builds

## Phase 2: Interaction Pattern Validation

### Touch Targets & Accessibility
- [ ] All buttons meet minimum 44pt touch target requirements
- [ ] Swipe gestures work correctly on lists and cards
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh functionality in appropriate views
- [ ] Modal presentations and dismissals work smoothly

### Settings Navigation
- [ ] All settings categories expand and navigate correctly
- [ ] Toggle switches respond properly to touches
- [ ] Slider controls provide smooth interaction
- [ ] Text fields accept input correctly
- [ ] Picker selections work as expected

### Error Handling UI

- [ ] Service errors show appropriate user messages
- [ ] Recovery action buttons are functional
- [ ] Error states don't block critical app functionality

## Phase 3: Visual Consistency Validation

### Design System Compliance
- [ ] Premium glass effects render correctly
- [ ] Color schemes are consistent across all views
- [ ] Typography scaling works with Dynamic Type
- [ ] Animation transitions are smooth and appropriate
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback

### Responsive Design
- [ ] iPhone layout is optimized for device size
- [ ] iPad layout utilizes larger screen effectively
- [ ] Portrait and landscape orientations work correctly
- [ ] Safe area handling is correct on all devices

## Phase 4: Performance & Memory Validation

### App Launch & Navigation
- [ ] App launches within 1 second target
- [ ] Tab switching is responsive (<100ms)
- [ ] View transitions are smooth (60fps)
- [ ] Memory usage stays within 500MB limit

### Background Behavior
- [ ] App handles background/foreground transitions correctly
- [ ] WebSocket connections resume properly
- [ ] Local data persistence works across app restarts

## Validation Commands

### Using Mobile MCP Tools
```bash
# Initialize simulator
mcp__mobile__mobile_use_default_device

# Take screenshots for visual validation
mcp__mobile__mobile_take_screenshot

# Test navigation flows
mcp__mobile__mobile_list_elements_on_screen
mcp__mobile__mobile_click_on_screen_at_coordinates

# Validate touch targets
mcp__mobile__mobile_swipe_on_screen
```

### Manual Testing Required
1. **Launch iOS Simulator with LeanVibe app**
2. **Navigate through all major user flows**
3. **Test error scenarios (disconnect network, invalid data)**
4. **Verify feature flags work correctly in different build configurations**
5. **Validate accessibility features with VoiceOver enabled**

## Success Criteria

✅ **Navigation**: All primary navigation flows work without errors
✅ **Feature Flags**: Production features are properly hidden
✅ **Error Handling**: Users receive helpful feedback and recovery options
✅ **Performance**: App meets all performance targets
✅ **Visual**: Design system is consistently applied
✅ **Accessibility**: App is usable with assistive technologies

## Manual Validation Notes

> This checklist should be executed manually in iOS Simulator or on physical device
> due to Mobile MCP environment configuration requirements.

**Status**: Pending manual validation in iOS development environment
**Priority**: High - Required before production deployment
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours comprehensive testing
