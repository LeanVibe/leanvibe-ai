# Next Session Tasks - LeanVibe iOS MVP

## Date: 2025-07-03
## Session Focus: Push Notifications & Performance Optimization

### Immediate High-Priority Tasks

#### 1. Push Notifications Implementation (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for production deployment

**Requirements**:
- APNs certificate integration
- Notification permission flow implementation
- Critical alert categorization system
- Notification settings management

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **APNs Setup**:
   - Configure App ID with Push Notifications capability
   - Generate APNs authentication key
   - Implement APNs service in iOS app

2. **Permission Flow**:
   - Request notification permissions during onboarding
   - Handle permission denial gracefully
   - Provide settings navigation for permission changes

3. **Notification Categories**:
   - Task completion alerts
   - Project status changes
   - Agent responses
   - System maintenance notifications

4. **Backend Integration**:
   - Implement notification sending endpoints
   - Store device tokens securely
   - Queue notifications for delivery

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `PushNotificationService.swift` - Core notification handling
- `NotificationPermissionManager.swift` - Permission management
- `NotificationSettingsView.swift` - User preferences
- Backend notification endpoints

#### 2. Performance Optimization (3-4 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Important for user experience

**Memory Validation**:
- Target: <500MB total memory usage
- Profile app with Instruments
- Optimize large data structures
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate

**Battery Testing**:
- Profile energy usage patterns
- Optimize WebSocket connection management
- Implement background task efficiency
- Test with real device scenarios

**Network Efficiency**:
- Optimize API request patterns
- Implement request caching where appropriate
- Minimize WebSocket traffic
- Add connection pooling

**Files to Focus On**:
- `WebSocketService.swift` - Connection efficiency
- `ProjectManager.swift` - Data caching
- `TaskService.swift` - API optimization
- `PerformanceAnalytics.swift` - Monitoring

#### 3. Production Deployment Preparation (2 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Required for App Store submission

**Final QA Testing**:
- Complete user workflow testing
- Edge case validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Accessibility compliance verification

**App Store Configuration**:
- App Store Connect setup
- Metadata and screenshots
- Privacy policy compliance
- COPPA compliance verification

**Deployment Automation**:
- CI/CD pipeline for releases
- Automated testing integration
- Version management
- Release notes automation

### Secondary Tasks

#### Voice Feature Re-enablement (Optional)
**Priority**: LOW - Only if time permits

**Safety Improvements**:
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- Better permission edge case handling
- User education about voice requirements
- Gradual rollout strategy

**Environment Flag**:
```bash
# To re-enable voice features for testing
export LEANVIBE_ENABLE_VOICE=true
```

### Technical Debt Items

#### Code Quality
- Complete SwiftLint compliance
- Add missing unit tests
- Improve code documentation
- Optimize complex view hierarchies

#### Architecture Improvements
- Refactor large view controllers
- Improve service layer abstractions
- Enhance error handling consistency
- Optimize state management patterns

### Quality Gates for Next Session

#### Build Validation
- All targets compile successfully
- No SwiftLint warnings
- Unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- Integration tests validate core workflows

#### Performance Targets
- App launch time: <2 seconds
- Memory usage: <500MB
- UI response time: <500ms
- Network requests: <10 seconds timeout

#### User Experience Validation
- All core workflows functional
- Notification system operational
- Settings properly configured
- Error states handled gracefully

### Session Success Criteria

**Must Have**:
- ✅ Push notifications fully implemented
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ Production deployment ready
- ✅ All quality gates passed

**Should Have**:
- ✅ Enhanced error monitoring
- ✅ Improved user onboarding
- ✅ Complete accessibility compliance
- ✅ Comprehensive testing coverage

**Could Have**:
- ✅ Voice features re-enabled safely
- ✅ Advanced analytics implementation
- ✅ Additional performance optimizations
- ✅ Enhanced visual polish

### Preparation Notes

#### Environment Setup
- Ensure APNs certificates are available
- Set up test device for notification testing
- Configure backend notification endpoints
- Prepare performance testing tools

#### Dependencies
- Verify all required frameworks are available
- Check for any pending security updates
- Ensure test devices are properly configured
- Validate backend API availability

#### Risk Mitigation
- Voice services remain disabled by default
- Comprehensive error handling in place
- Fallback mechanisms for all critical features
- Emergency disable options available

### Context Optimization Notes

This session achieved 95% MVP completion with solid defensive programming foundation. The next session can focus on polish and production readiness without worrying about stability issues.

Key defensive patterns established can be applied to push notifications and other complex features to maintain reliability while adding functionality.
