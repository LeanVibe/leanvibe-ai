## 📋 Success Criteria for Next Session

### Must Achieve ✅
- [ ] Security audit initiated with findings documented
- [ ] Critical vulnerabilities identified and prioritized
- [ ] Edge case test plan created and execution started
- [ ] UX polish roadmap defined with mockups
- [ ] GlobalErrorManager issues resolved

### Should Achieve 🎯
- [ ] 25% of security hardening complete
- [ ] Key edge cases implemented and tested
- [ ] Animation improvements visible
- [ ] Analytics framework design complete

### Could Achieve 🌟
- [ ] Security score baseline established
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline prototype working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks improved by 10%

## 🧭 Implementation Strategy

### Worktree Setup
```bash
# Security hardening worktree
git worktree add ../leanvibe-security feature/security-hardening

# Edge case testing worktree
git worktree add ../leanvibe-edge-cases feature/edge-case-testing

# UX polish worktree
git worktree add ../leanvibe-ux-polish feature/ux-polish
```

### Parallel Execution
- Security agent: Focus on audit and critical fixes
- QA agent: Implement edge case scenarios
- UX agent: Polish animations and accessibility

## 📚 Context from Previous Sessions

### Combined Technical Debt
1. **Build Issues**: GlobalErrorManager, RetryManager
2. **Agent Code**: VoiceManager, PushNotificationService refactoring
3. **Test Coverage**: UI tests implemented, integration needed

### Strategic Decisions
- Production robustness before technical debt
- Security and infrastructure enable deployment
- Phased approach reduces risk

### Key Metrics to Track
- Security score (target: 95+)
- Edge case coverage (target: 90+)
- UX polish score (target: 92+)
- Performance benchmarks maintained

## 🎯 Next Session Focus

**Primary**: Begin Phase 1 Security Hardening Sprint
1. Launch security audit with specialized agent
2. Document all security findings
3. Prioritize critical vulnerabilities
4. Begin implementing security fixes

**Secondary**: Parallel edge case and UX work
1. QA agent implements network scenarios
2. UX agent starts animation polish
3. Coordinate findings across agents

**Success Factor**: Clean handoff between planning and execution phases with specialized agents taking ownership of their domains.
