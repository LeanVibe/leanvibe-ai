# Test-Driven Development Implementation

Implement features using strict TDD methodology with Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

## Instructions

Implement $ARGUMENTS using Test-Driven Development:

1. **Red Phase - Write Failing Test**
   - Write a specific test that defines the desired behavior
   - Ensure the test fails for the right reason
   - Keep the test simple and focused on one behavior
   - Run the test to confirm it fails

2. **Green Phase - Make Test Pass**
   - Write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass
   - Don't worry about code quality or optimization yet
   - Focus solely on making the test pass
   - Run the test to confirm it passes

3. **Refactor Phase - Improve Code**
   - Improve the code structure while keeping tests passing
   - Remove duplication and improve readability
   - Apply design patterns where appropriate
   - Ensure all tests continue to pass

4. **Cycle Repetition**
   - Repeat the Red-Green-Refactor cycle for each new requirement
   - Keep each cycle small and focused
   - Commit after each successful cycle
   - Build up functionality incrementally

5. **Integration Testing**
   - Add integration tests for complex interactions
   - Test error conditions and edge cases
   - Ensure proper integration with existing code
   - Verify end-to-end functionality

6. **Documentation and Review**
   - Document the implemented functionality
   - Review test coverage and quality
   - Ensure tests serve as living documentation
   - Prepare for code review and feedback
