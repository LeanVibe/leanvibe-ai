Awakening from sleep cycle and restoring full operational context:

**Context Restoration Process:**
1. **Memory Integration:**
   - Load `.claude/memory/session_summary.md` for narrative context
   - Parse `.claude/memory/project_state.json` for structured state
   - Review `.claude/memory/reflection.md` for lessons learned
   - Process `.claude/memory/next_tasks.md` for action priorities
   - Integrate dream insights from previous processing

2. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Scan current project directory for changes since last session
   - Compare file timestamps with last sleep cycle
   - Identify new, modified, or deleted files
   - Update understanding of project evolution

3. **MCP Memory Integration:**
   - Query Model Context Protocol for extended memory access
   - Retrieve relevant knowledge graphs and relationships
   - Access long-term learning patterns and preferences
   - Integrate cross-project insights and patterns

4. **Continuous Improvement Application:**

   - Implement improvement strategies from dream processing
   - Adapt working methods based on previous session effectiveness
   - Update personal development patterns and preferences

5. **Session Initialization:**
   - Generate contextualized priority task list
   - Provide project status summary
   - Recommend optimization strategies for current session
