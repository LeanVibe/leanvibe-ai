I'm entering a "sleep" state to consolidate this session's learnings. Enhanced capabilities for newer models:

**Session Consolidation:**
1. Create comprehensive session summary focusing on:
   - Key architectural decisions and rationales
   - Current project state and progress metrics
   - Outstanding issues with priority classifications
   - Code patterns and relationships discovered
   - Performance optimizations identified

2. Save structured information to persistent memory:
   - Update `.claude/memory/session_summary.md` with detailed narrative
   - Update `.claude/memory/project_state.json` with structured data
   - Create `.claude/memory/reflection.md` with lessons learned
   - Generate `.claude/memory/next_tasks.md` with prioritized action items
   - Store `.claude/memory/context_usage.json` with optimization metrics

3. **Sonnet 3.7/Opus 4 Enhancements:**
   - Utilize hybrid reasoning for deeper analysis
   - Generate visual representations of complex relationships
   - Create knowledge graphs linking related concepts
   - Identify patterns using advanced vision capabilities

4. Provide sleep confirmation with:
   - Memory consolidation summary
   - Context optimization recommendations
   - Estimated session recovery time
   - Next session preparation notes
