# Comprehensive Code Quality Check

Perform thorough code quality and security analysis with static analysis integration.

## Instructions

1. **Static Analysis**
   - Run all configured linters (ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop, etc.)
   - Execute type checking (TypeScript, mypy, etc.)
   - Check code formatting consistency
   - Analyze code complexity metrics

2. **Security Scanning**
   - Run security vulnerability scanners
   - Check for common security anti-patterns
   - Validate input sanitization
   - Review authentication and authorization logic

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
   - Check for memory leaks or excessive resource usage
   - Analyze database query efficiency
   - Review algorithm complexity

4. **Code Standards Compliance**
   - Verify adherence to project coding standards
   - Check naming conventions
   - Validate documentation coverage
   - Ensure proper error handling patterns

5. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Check for outdated dependencies
   - Identify security vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Verify license compatibility
   - Remove unused dependencies

6. **Report Generation**
   - Summarize all findings with severity levels
   - Provide actionable recommendations
   - Prioritize issues by impact and effort
   - Generate detailed report for review
