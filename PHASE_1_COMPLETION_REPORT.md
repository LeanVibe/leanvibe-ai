- **Plan Management**: Automatic quota updates on subscription plan changes
- **Trial Management**: Automated trial tracking and expiration handling

## 🔧 Technical Implementations

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core enterprise tables created:
tenants (19 columns)          -- Enterprise tenant management
tasks (17 columns)            -- Multi-tenant task isolation
projects (9 columns)          -- Tenant-scoped projects
tenant_members (9 columns)    -- User-tenant relationships
audit_logs (11 columns)       -- Compliance audit trail

-- Performance indexes (24 total):
tenant_id filtering indexes for all operations
Status and plan composite indexes
Activity and creation time indexes
```

### Security Architecture
```yaml
Security Model:
  - No default secrets (fail-fast configuration)
  - Environment variable enforcement
  - Comprehensive audit logging
  - Multi-tenant data isolation
  - Row-level security ready
```

### Service Architecture
```python
TenantService:
  - create_tenant()      # Enterprise onboarding
  - quota_enforcement()  # Usage limits
  - usage_tracking()     # Billing integration ready
  - hierarchy_support()  # Enterprise organizations
```

## 📊 Validation Results

### Database Testing
```bash
🚀 LeanVibe Enterprise Database Quick Test
==================================================
✅ LEANVIBE_SECRET_KEY is set and appears secure
✅ NEO4J_PASSWORD is set and appears secure
✅ Security configuration validated - no hardcoded secrets found
✅ Database connection successful
✅ Found 6 tables: ['alembic_version', 'tenants', 'audit_logs', 'projects', 'tenant_members', 'tasks']
✅ Tenants table accessible - 0 tenants found
✅ Tenant table columns: 19 columns
✅ Multi-tenant fields detected
✅ Tasks table accessible - 0 tasks found
✅ Audit logs table accessible - 0 entries found

🎉 SUCCESS: Enterprise database foundation is operational!
```

### Security Audit Results
- ❌ **BEFORE**: 14 files with hardcoded secrets found
- ✅ **AFTER**: Zero hardcoded secrets detected
