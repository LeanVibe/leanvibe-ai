# LeanVibe Startup Factory Implementation Plan
**Phase 1A: Autonomous MVP Generation System**

## Executive Summary

Transform LeanVibe from an enterprise development platform into a hybrid system that generates complete MVPs autonomously while maintaining enterprise capabilities. This represents a strategic pivot to capture the unprecedented "startup factory" market.

## Strategic Context

### Current State
- **Market Position**: Enterprise development platform for 28M developers
- **Revenue Model**: $200/month per developer seat (break-even: 3,555 customers)
- **TAM**: $50B+ developer productivity market
- **Status**: 98% production ready with comprehensive enterprise foundation

### Target State (Phase 1A Complete)
- **Market Position**: Only autonomous development platform generating complete MVPs
- **Revenue Model**: Dual streams - Enterprise ($200/month) + Factory ($5,000/MVP)
- **TAM**: $100B+ (enterprise + entire startup ecosystem)
- **Competitive Advantage**: End-to-end idea → deployed MVP generation
