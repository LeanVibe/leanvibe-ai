## ü§ù **Human-AI Collaboration Patterns**

### **Confidence-Based Task Assignment**

| Confidence Level | Assignment Strategy | Human Involvement |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 90-100% | AI Autonomous | Review only |
| 80-89% | AI Primary, Human Review | Code review required |
| 70-79% | AI Assisted | Paired programming |
| 60-69% | Human Primary, AI Support | AI provides analysis |
| <60% | Human Led | AI provides context |

### **Handoff Protocols**

#### **AI ‚Üí Human Handoffs**
```markdown
**Handoff Trigger**: Confidence <80% or complexity detected
**Information Required**:
- Current progress and completion percentage
- Specific challenges or blockers encountered
- Recommended approach or alternatives considered
- Quality gate status and test results
- Next steps and estimated effort

**Example AI Handoff Message**:
"Task: Implement user authentication - 65% complete
Challenge: Complex OAuth integration requires security review
Progress: Basic login flow implemented, tests passing
Blocker: Security team approval needed for token storage
Recommendation: Review security architecture with @security-team
Estimated effort remaining: 4-6 hours after approval"
```

#### **Human ‚Üí AI Handoffs**
```markdown
**Handoff Trigger**: Routine implementation after design approval
**Information Required**:
- Clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- Design decisions and constraints
- Implementation approach approved

**Example Human Handoff Message**:
"Task: Implement approved UI design for settings screen
Requirements: See issue #156 with complete acceptance criteria
Design: Figma link with final approved mockups
Approach: Use existing SettingsCardView component pattern
Tests: 90% coverage required, focus on accessibility
Quality: Full COPPA compliance validation needed"
```
