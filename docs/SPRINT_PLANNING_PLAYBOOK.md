## ðŸ“‹ **Overview**

This playbook provides a comprehensive guide for executing Sprint Planning ceremonies in an Agile-AI integrated environment. It combines traditional Scrum practices with AI-enhanced planning capabilities for optimal sprint delivery.

### **Purpose**
- Standardize sprint planning process across AI and human team members
- Maximize velocity through intelligent task breakdown and estimation
- Ensure consistent quality and delivery predictability
- Enable seamless handoffs between AI and human work streams

### **Scope**
- 2-week sprint cycles (adaptable to 1-week for urgent releases)
- Mixed AI-human development teams
- GitHub Projects integration for tracking and automation
- DynaStory iOS project context with COPPA compliance requirements

## ðŸŽ¯ **Sprint Planning Framework**

### **Pre-Planning Preparation (AI-Automated)**

#### **Command: `sprint-plan.md`**
Execute 2 days before Sprint Planning ceremony:

```bash
sprint-plan.md "2-week sprint starting [DATE], focus: [THEME]"
```

**AI Responsibilities:**
1. **Velocity Analysis**
   - Calculate team velocity from last 3 sprints
   - Account for team capacity changes (holidays, new members)
   - Generate velocity confidence intervals (80%, 90%, 95%)

2. **Backlog Analysis**
   - Review and prioritize product backlog items
   - Identify dependencies and blockers
   - Suggest story splitting for large items (>8 story points)

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Flag high-risk items requiring human expertise
   - Identify external dependencies needing coordination
   - Assess technical debt impact on velocity

4. **Draft Sprint Scope**
   - Generate optimized story selection
   - Balance feature work vs. technical debt (70/30 ratio)
   - Ensure COPPA compliance requirements covered

### **Sprint Planning Ceremony Structure**

#### **Part 1: Sprint Goal Definition (30 minutes)**
**Participants:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
**AI Role:** Context provider and analysis support

1. **Review Sprint Objective**
   - Product Owner presents sprint theme
   - AI provides velocity analysis and capacity assessment
   - Team validates scope feasibility

2. **Sprint Goal Formulation**
   - Define clear, measurable sprint goal
   - Align with product roadmap and user outcomes
   - Document in GitHub milestone

3. **High-Level Scope Agreement**
   - Review AI-suggested story selection
   - Adjust based on business priorities
   - Confirm preliminary sprint commitment

#### **Part 2: Task Breakdown and Estimation (60 minutes)**
**AI Commands Used:** `task-breakdown.md`, `implement-task.md`

1. **Story Decomposition**
   ```bash
   task-breakdown.md "Feature: [STORY TITLE]"
   ```
   - AI breaks stories into 1-3 day tasks
   - Identifies technical dependencies
   - Suggests implementation approach

2. **Estimation Session**
   - Team estimates using Planning Poker
   - AI provides complexity analysis as input
   - Document estimates in GitHub issues

3. **Capacity Validation**
   - Validate total commitment against team capacity
   - Account for code review, testing, documentation time
   - Buffer for unplanned work (15-20%)

#### **Part 3: Sprint Backlog Creation (30 minutes)**

1. **Final Story Selection**
   - Confirm stories fitting within sprint capacity
   - Prioritize by business value and dependencies
   - Create GitHub milestone and link stories

2. **Task Assignment Strategy**
   ```bash
   implement-task.md "[STORY] - [COMPONENT]"
   ```
   - Assign AI-suitable tasks to AI agents
   - Reserve complex/creative tasks for humans
   - Define handoff points and review criteria

3. **Definition of Done Validation**
   - Review DoD criteria for each story
   - Ensure quality gates are understood
   - Plan automated validation sequence

## ðŸ¤– **AI Integration Patterns**

### **Automated Sprint Planning Triggers**

#### **Context-Based Triggers**
```markdown
## Auto-Sprint Planning Conditions
- **Sprint End -2 days**: Execute `sprint-plan.md`
- **Velocity Change >20%**: Recalculate capacity
- **Backlog Priority Shift**: Re-analyze story selection
- **Team Capacity Change**: Adjust sprint scope
```

#### **GitHub Integration**
```bash
# Automated milestone creation
gh milestone create "Sprint $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
  --due-date "$(date -d '+14 days' +%Y-%m-%d)" \
  --description "Sprint Goal: $SPRINT_GOAL"

# Story assignment to milestone
gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUMBER --milestone "Sprint $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"

# Label application for tracking
gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUMBER --add-label "sprint-active,ai-task"
```

### **Human-AI Collaboration Matrix**

| Task Type | AI Capability | Human Involvement | Handoff Protocol |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Feature Implementation | 90%+ autonomous | Code review only | `create-pr.md` â†’ Human review |
| Bug Fixes | 85% autonomous | Complex issues escalation | `fix-issue.md` â†’ Confidence <70% escalate |
| Architecture Design | 60% autonomous | Design review required | `architecture-review.md` â†’ Human approval |
| UI/UX Implementation | 75% autonomous | Design validation | `review-screen.md` â†’ Design team review |
| Performance Optimization | 80% autonomous | Impact assessment | `optimize.md` â†’ Performance team validation |
| Security Implementation | 50% autonomous | Security review mandatory | `check.md` â†’ Security team approval |

### **Quality Gate Integration**

#### **Sprint Planning Quality Checklist**

- [ ] Documentation requirements specified
- [ ] Rollback plan for high-risk changes
```

#### **Automated Validation Commands**
```bash
# Pre-sprint validation
check.md --scope=sprint-backlog --focus=completeness

# Capacity validation
sprint-plan.md --validate-capacity --team-velocity=$VELOCITY

# Risk assessment
code-analysis.md --scope=sprint-stories --focus=risk-assessment
```

## ðŸ“Š **Sprint Metrics and Tracking**

### **Velocity Tracking**

#### **Story Point Velocity**
- **Planned vs. Actual**: Track commitment accuracy
- **AI vs. Human**: Compare velocity by work type
- **Story Size Distribution**: Optimize for consistent delivery

#### **AI-Specific Metrics**
- **Autonomous Completion Rate**: % of AI tasks completed without human intervention
- **Quality Gate Pass Rate**: % of AI work passing quality checks on first attempt
- **Estimation Accuracy**: AI estimation vs. actual completion time
- **Handoff Efficiency**: Time between AI completion and human review

### **Sprint Burndown Automation**

#### **Daily Updates via GitHub Actions**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/sprint-burndown.yml
name: Update Sprint Burndown

    steps:
      - name: Update Sprint Metrics
        run: |
          # Calculate remaining story points
          # Update burndown chart
          # Post to team channel
```

#### **AI Progress Reporting**
