# Agile-AI Workflow Integration Plan
**Version 1.0** | **Created**: June 25, 2025 | **Status**: Draft for Review

---

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

### **Overview**
This comprehensive plan establishes a framework for integrating established Agile methodologies (Scrum/Kanban) with AI-driven development workflows. The goal is to create a seamless collaboration model where AI agents and human developers work together using standardized processes that leverage the strengths of both.

### **Current State**
- 25 custom commands in `.claude/commands/` with varying documentation quality
- Ad-hoc workflow patterns without formal Agile alignment
- Memory management system with sleep-wake-dream cycles
- Quality gates defined but not consistently integrated with commands
- Strong technical foundation (Phase 0.6 and Phase 1 complete) but lacking process standardization

### **Goals**
1. **Standardize Command Documentation**: Create consistent documentation for all 25 commands
2. **Align with Agile Practices**: Map commands to Scrum ceremonies and Kanban workflows
3. **Enable Human-AI Collaboration**: Define clear handoff points and communication protocols
4. **Automate Quality Gates**: Integrate command execution with quality assurance processes
5. **Optimize Workflow Efficiency**: Reduce friction and improve development velocity

### **Expected Outcomes**
- 40% reduction in context switching between human and AI work
- 60% improvement in task completion predictability
- 80% automation of routine quality checks
- 100% traceability from user stories to implementation
- Scalable process that works for both small features and large initiatives

| 80-89% | Execute with logging | Progress updates | Every 2 hours |
| 70-79% | Execute with validation | Review checkpoints | Every hour |
| 60-69% | Collaborative mode | Active guidance | Real-time |
| 50-59% | Human consultation | Joint decision making | Within 30 min |
| < 50% | Human handoff | AI support role | Immediate |

### Escalation Triggers
Immediately escalate to human review for:
1. **Security Implications**: Any security-related changes or vulnerabilities
2. **Child Safety**: COPPA compliance or child safety concerns
3. **Performance Regression**: >10% degradation in critical metrics
4. **Architecture Changes**: Significant structural modifications
5. **Business Logic**: Complex domain-specific requirements

- **Blocker Notifications**: Immediate for any blocking issues
- **Decision Points**: Request human input before major changes
- **Completion Summaries**: Detailed report with metrics and lessons learned
```

### **Advanced Automation Rules**

```markdown
## Intelligent Command Chaining

### Context-Aware Automation
The system automatically chains commands based on context and outcomes:

1. **Issue Resolution Chain**:
   ```
   debug-issue.md → fix-issue.md → check.md → run-ci.md → create-pr.md
   ```

2. **Feature Development Chain**:
   ```
   task-breakdown.md → implement-task.md → check.md → review-screen.md → create-pr.md
   ```

3. **Quality Improvement Chain**:
   ```
   code-analysis.md → optimize.md → clean.md → check.md → run-ci.md
   ```

4. **Documentation Chain**:
   ```
   create-docs.md → review-screen.md → check.md → create-pr.md
   ```

### Adaptive Triggers
Commands adapt their behavior based on:
- **Project Phase**: Different validation rules for MVP vs. enhancement phases
- **Time of Day**: Lighter operations during off-hours
- **Team Availability**: Escalation timing based on team schedules
- **Sprint Stage**: Different priorities for sprint start vs. end
- **Risk Level**: Enhanced validation for high-risk changes

### Performance Optimization
- **Command Caching**: Reuse results from recent command executions
- **Parallel Execution**: Run independent commands simultaneously
- **Smart Scheduling**: Optimize command execution order for efficiency
- **Resource Management**: Monitor and optimize memory and CPU usage
```
