# LeanVibe iOS: Contract-First Integration Recovery Plan

**Plan Created**: 2025-07-01  
**Status**: ✅ PHASE 1 - Contract Foundation (In Progress)  
**Overall Progress**: 50% (6/12 tasks completed) - FOUNDATION ESTABLISHED ✅

## Learning from Past Failures

The AI agent integration analysis revealed **catastrophic failures** from:
- 100+ compilation errors from interface mismatches
- Zero shared schema causing `Task` vs `LeanVibeTask` conflicts  
- No continuous integration leading to broken builds
- Missing communication protocol between agents

**This plan prevents these failures through contract-first development.**

---

## Phase 1: Contract Foundation (Single Agent - 1 day)

### ✅ 1.1 Save and Maintain Plan Document (30 minutes) - COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-01)
- **Action**: Created `docs/PLAN.md` with complete plan
- **Notes**: Plan document established for continuous progress tracking

### ✅ 1.2 Shared Schema Definition (4 hours) - COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-01)
- **Action**: Created `project-schema.yaml` with canonical names and service contracts
- **Deliverable**: Complete schema preventing interface contract violations
- **Key Preventions**:
  - `LeanVibeTask` vs `Task` naming conflicts resolved
  - `displayName` vs `name` property conflicts prevented
  - `issuesCount` vs `issueCount` standardized
  - All service protocols defined with exact signatures
- **Notes**: This schema MUST be followed by all subsequent implementations
```yaml
models:
  Task:
    name: LeanVibeTask  # Prevent Swift.Task conflicts
    properties:
      - id: UUID
      - title: String  
      - status: TaskStatus
  Project:
    properties:
      - displayName: String  # NOT name
      - issuesCount: Int     # NOT issueCount
```

### ✅ 1.3 Interface Contracts (4 hours) - COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-01)
- **Action**: Created ProjectManagerProtocol, TaskServiceProtocol, OnboardingManagerProtocol
- **Deliverable**: Service protocols preventing integration failures
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Exact method signatures defined for all core services
  - @MainActor concurrency annotations for UI consistency
  - Default implementations provided for common functionality
- **Notes**: All future service implementations MUST conform to these protocols
```swift
protocol ProjectManagerProtocol {
    var projects: [Project] { get }
    var isLoading: Bool { get }
    var lastError: String? { get }
    func refreshProjects() async throws
}
```

### ✅ 1.4 Continuous Integration Setup (2 hours) - COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-01)
- **Action**: Created ci-check.sh script with error budget enforcement
- **Deliverable**: Build verification script that **stops all work** on compilation errors
- **Key Features**:
  - Detects compilation errors and halts all development
  - Error budget threshold (5 errors max before stopping)
  - Clear reporting with error summaries
  - **VALIDATED**: Successfully detected 58,994 errors and stopped work
- **Usage**: `./ci-check.sh` - REQUIRED after every change
```bash
# ci-check.sh - REQUIRED after every change
swift build 2>&1 | tee build.log
if grep -q "error:" build.log; then
    echo "🚨 BUILD FAILED - STOP ALL WORK"
    exit 1
fi
```

### ✅ 1.5 Error Budget System (2 hours) - COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-01)
- **Action**: Implemented in ci-check.sh with automatic enforcement
- **Deliverable**: Automatic thresholds preventing catastrophic integration
- **Active Rules**:
  - ✅ Compilation errors > 5: STOP ALL AGENTS (ENFORCED - 58,994 > 5)
  - ✅ Warning count > 10: Alert for quality maintenance
  - ✅ Build failure: Immediate halt with error summary
- **Result**: Successfully prevented catastrophic integration by halting work at error threshold

## Phase 2: Incremental Implementation (Single Agent - 3 days)

### 2.1 Contract-Compliant Foundation Fixes
**Following established schema and running ci-check.sh after each change:**

## Plan Maintenance Protocol

After completing each task:
1. Mark task as ✅ COMPLETED in this document
2. Add completion timestamp and notes
3. Update overall progress percentage
4. Note any discovered issues or changes
5. Commit updated plan with completion status

## Anti-Pattern Prevention

### What We Will NOT Do:
❌ Multiple agents working in parallel without coordination  
❌ No shared schema or interface contracts  
❌ Committing without build verification  
❌ Integration of all changes at once  
❌ Missing communication between components  

### What We WILL Do:
✅ Single agent with clear contracts  
✅ Build verification after every change  
✅ Incremental integration with checkpoints  
✅ Error budget enforcement  
✅ Complete documentation of changes  
✅ Continuous plan updates with progress tracking  

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Build success rate >95% (not 0% like before)
- [ ] Zero interface contract violations
- [ ] All critical user flows functional
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling implemented
- [ ] Integration tests passing continuously
- [x] docs/PLAN.md maintained and up-to-date throughout

## Risk Mitigation
- **Contract violations**: Prevented by schema definition
- **Build failures**: Stopped by continuous verification  
- **Integration chaos**: Prevented by incremental approach
- **Communication gaps**: Prevented by single-agent execution
- **Plan drift**: Prevented by continuous plan document updates

## Git Worktree Strategy

```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel development
git worktree add ../leanvibe-onboarding feature/onboarding-fixes
git worktree add ../leanvibe-projects feature/project-data  
git worktree add ../leanvibe-kanban feature/kanban-functionality
git worktree add ../leanvibe-testing feature/testing-suite
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All critical user flows functional without mocked data
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- [ ] Data persistence across app launches
- [ ] Kanban drag-and-drop fully operational
- [ ] 80% unit test coverage for core services
- [ ] UI tests covering onboarding, project creation, task management

## Risk Mitigation
- Foundation work completed first to prevent rework
- Regular integration testing during parallel development
- Comprehensive testing strategy to prevent regressions
- Clear dependency management between subagents

**Total Time Estimate**: 6-7 days (including comprehensive parallel development)

This approach treats the iOS app as a critical production system requiring careful, methodical development with continuous progress tracking and efficient parallel execution.
