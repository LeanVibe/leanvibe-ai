from rich.console import Console
from rich.table import Table
from rich.progress import Progress
from rich.panel import Panel
from rich.prompt import Prompt

class ModernCLI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.console = Console()
        
    def show_project_dashboard(self):
        """Beautiful project dashboard in terminal"""
        table = Table(title="LeanVibe Projects")
        table.add_column("Project", style="cyan")
        table.add_column("Status", style="green")
        table.add_column("Health", justify="right", style="magenta")
        
        # Real-time project data from backend
        for project in self.get_projects():
            table.add_row(project.name, project.status, f"{project.health}%")
            
        self.console.print(table)
        
    def interactive_voice_commands(self):
        """CLI voice command simulation"""
        with Progress() as progress:
            task = progress.add_task("Listening for voice commands...", total=100)
            # Interactive voice simulation matching iOS app
```

### 2. iOS App Feature Parity

        display_architecture_ascii()
    elif "refresh dashboard" in command.lower():
        refresh_project_data()

# Architecture viewer CLI version
@app.command()
def architecture(
    project_id: str,
    format: str = typer.Option("ascii", help="Output format: ascii, mermaid, json")
):
    """Display project architecture (CLI version of iOS Architecture Viewer)"""
    if format == "ascii":
        render_ascii_architecture(project_id)
    elif format == "mermaid":
        generate_mermaid_cli(project_id)

# Kanban board CLI
@app.command()
