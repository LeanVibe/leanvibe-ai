- **New Phase**: 5 - Voice Interface (High Priority - Unique Differentiator)  
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Working Directory**: `../leanvibe-ios-voice`
- **New Branch**: `feature/ios-voice-interface`

## Your New Mission

Build a comprehensive voice interface system that allows users to control the LeanVibe agent and dashboard using natural speech commands, starting with "Hey LeanVibe" wake phrase detection.

## Specific Tasks

### Core Voice System Deliverables

**Voice Recognition Infrastructure**:
- iOS Speech framework integration
- Privacy-first on-device speech recognition
- "Hey LeanVibe" wake phrase detection
- Continuous listening with battery optimization
- Voice command processing and confirmation

**Voice Interface Components**:
- Voice modal with waveform visualization
- Animated voice UI with real-time feedback
- Voice command confirmation dialogs
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Integration with existing chat interface

**Natural Language Processing**:
- Voice command mapping to WebSocket commands
- Parameter extraction from speech
- Context-aware command interpretation
- Integration with backend voice APIs

## Technical Requirements

**Files to Create**:
```
LeanVibe-iOS-App/LeanVibe/
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ VoiceCommand.swift           # Voice command data models
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SpeechRecognitionService.swift # iOS Speech framework integration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ VoiceManager.swift            # Voice system coordination
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ VoicePermissionManager.swift  # Microphone permissions
â””â”€â”€ Views/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Voice/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ VoiceCommandView.swift    # Main voice interface modal
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ VoiceWaveformView.swift   # Animated waveform display
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ VoicePermissionSetupView.swift # Permission onboarding
```

**iOS Framework Integration**:
- **Speech Framework**: For speech-to-text conversion
- **AVFoundation**: For audio session management
- **Combine**: For reactive voice state management
- **SwiftUI**: For voice interface animations

## Voice Command System

**Wake Phrase Implementation**:
```swift
// Continuous listening for "Hey LeanVibe"
// Variants: "Hey Lean Vibe", "Hi LeanVibe", "Hello LeanVibe"
// Background processing with minimal battery impact
```

**Command Categories**:
1. **Project Commands**: "analyze current project", "refresh dashboard"
2. **Navigation Commands**: "show projects", "open settings", "go to chat"
3. **Agent Commands**: "status check", "list files", "run tests"
4. **System Commands**: "connect to agent", "disconnect", "clear messages"

## Backend Integration

**Voice Command APIs** (from BETA agent):
```python
POST   /voice/{client_id}/command      # Process voice commands
GET    /voice/commands                 # List available commands
```

**WebSocket Integration**:
- Route voice commands through existing WebSocket
- Real-time command confirmation
- Voice command history and analytics

## Privacy & Permissions

**Privacy-First Design**:
- All speech processing on-device
- No voice data sent to servers
- Clear permission requests and explanations
- User control over voice features

**Required Permissions**:
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Microphone access required for voice commands to control LeanVibe agent</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>Speech recognition enables voice control of LeanVibe features</string>
```

## Performance Requirements

- **Wake Phrase Detection**: <500ms response time
- **Speech Recognition**: <2s processing for commands
- **Battery Impact**: <5% additional drain per hour
- **Memory Usage**: <30MB for voice system
- **Background Processing**: Efficient wake phrase monitoring

## UI/UX Requirements

**Voice Interface Design**:
- Floating voice button in dashboard
- Animated waveform during listening
- Clear visual feedback for recognition states
- Voice command confirmation overlays
- Error states and retry mechanisms

**Interaction Flow**:
1. User says "Hey LeanVibe" or taps voice button
2. System activates with visual/haptic feedback
3. User speaks command naturally
4. System shows recognized text for confirmation
5. Command executed with feedback

## Integration Points

**Dashboard Integration**:
- Voice button accessible from all tabs
- Voice commands can control dashboard navigation
- Project-specific voice commands
- Real-time status updates via voice

**Chat Integration**:
- Voice commands sent through existing WebSocket
- Voice input alternative to text input
- Voice message history in chat log

## Testing Requirements

**Voice System Tests**:
- Wake phrase detection accuracy
- Speech recognition performance
- Command processing and execution
- Permission handling
- Background processing efficiency

**Integration Tests**:
- Voice â†’ WebSocket â†’ Backend pipeline
- Dashboard control via voice commands
- Multi-language support (if required)
