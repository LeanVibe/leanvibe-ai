## üéØ Archive Usage Guidelines

### ‚úÖ **When to Reference Historical Documentation**

**Business Context & Strategy**
- Understanding original market research and competitive positioning
- Reviewing customer personas and use case validation
- Accessing foundational design philosophy and decision rationale

**Historical Decision Context**
- Understanding why certain technical choices were made
- Reviewing evolution of product strategy and scope
- Accessing original feasibility studies and technical research

**Lessons Learned & Pattern Recognition**
- Understanding scope evolution from simple MVP to enterprise platform
- Learning from implementation reality gaps and planning assumptions
- Reviewing successful patterns and approaches to avoid repeating mistakes

### ‚ùå **When NOT to Reference Archived Documentation**

**Current Implementation Work**
- Use `/docs/core/` for current system architecture and specifications
- Use `/docs/organized/` for active development and production readiness
- Use active agent documentation for current task specifications

**Production Deployment**
- Archived setup guides are outdated - use current development workflow
- Legacy sprint plans don't reflect current agent-based development
- Superseded MVP specifications may contain outdated requirements

**API Integration & Development**
- Use current backend documentation for API specifications
- Reference active agent tasks for implementation requirements
- Use production readiness documentation for deployment guidance
