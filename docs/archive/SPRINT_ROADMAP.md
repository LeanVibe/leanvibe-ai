## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategy

### Timeline Risks (High)
- **Issue**: 75% of core value still needs implementation
- **Mitigation**: Focus ruthlessly on MVP essentials, defer nice-to-haves
- **Contingency**: Reduce scope to basic code completion if needed

### Technical Risks (Medium)
- **Issue**: MLX performance may not meet targets
- **Mitigation**: Have fallback to smaller models ready
- **Contingency**: Consider cloud-assisted inference for complex operations

### Adoption Risks (Medium)
- **Issue**: Target users may find setup too complex
- **Mitigation**: Extensive beta testing with real developers
- **Contingency**: Simplify installation process, provide setup assistance

### Resource Risks (Low)
- **Issue**: Development team capacity constraints
- **Mitigation**: Clear sprint priorities and scope management
- **Contingency**: Extend timeline rather than compromise quality
