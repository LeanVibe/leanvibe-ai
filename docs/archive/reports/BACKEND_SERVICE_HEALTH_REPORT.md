# LeanVibe Backend Service Health Report

**Generated:** 2025-07-06 14:46:07

## Issues Found
1. Missing Python package: redis
2. Neo4j password mismatch between docker-compose and graph_service
3. Backend port configuration may be inconsistent

## Fixes Applied
1. Installed Redis Python client

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (if issues found):
1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start services
2. Install missing Python packages: `pip install redis>=4.6.0`
3. Verify Neo4j password matches in docker-compose.yml and graph_service.py
4. Test service connections with the integration test

### Model Upgrade (for better AI performance):
1. Consider upgrading from Phi-3-Mini to a larger model
2. Install Ollama and download DeepSeek R1 for better code generation
3. Implement model switching in the backend settings

### Testing:
1. Run comprehensive integration tests: `pytest tests/test_service_integration_comprehensive.py`
2. Add performance benchmarks for service response times
3. Monitor service health in production
