# KAPPA Agent - Task 01: iOS Kanban Board System Specialist

**Assignment Date**: Sprint 1 Foundation  
**Worktree**: `../leanvibe-ios-kanban`  
**Branch**: `feature/ios-kanban-board`  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  

## Mission Brief

You are the **iOS Kanban Board System Specialist** responsible for Phase 3 of the iOS enhancement plan. Your mission is to create an interactive task management system with drag-and-drop functionality and real-time updates.

## Context

- **Phase**: 3 - Task Management (High Priority)
- **Duration**: 2.5 weeks
- **Working Directory**: `../leanvibe-ios-kanban`
- **Integration Target**: Main iOS project dashboard system

## Specific Tasks

### Core Deliverables

**Interactive Kanban Board**:
- 4-column board layout (Backlog, In Progress, Testing, Done)
- Draggable task cards with smooth animations
- Real-time task updates from backend events
- Task approval/rejection flows
- Confidence indicators for AI-generated tasks

**Task Management**:
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Assign tasks to different columns
- Task metadata (priority, assignee, due date)
- Real-time synchronization with backend
- Visual feedback for task operations

## Technical Requirements

    ├── KanbanColumn.swift            # Column configuration
    └── TaskStatus.swift              # Task status enum
```

**Backend Integration**:
- Connect to Task Management APIs from BETA agent
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Handle task CRUD operations
- Process backend events for live updates

## UI/UX Requirements

**Visual Design**:
- Clean, modern card-based interface
- Smooth drag-and-drop animations
- Clear visual hierarchy and typography
- Confidence indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Loading states and error handling

**Interaction Design**:
- Intuitive drag-and-drop gestures
- Tap to view task details
- Pull-to-refresh for data sync
- Swipe actions for quick operations
- Haptic feedback for interactions

## Performance Requirements

- **Drag Animation**: 60fps smooth dragging
- **Board Load Time**: <1 second for up to 100 tasks
- **Real-time Updates**: <200ms latency
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB for board view
- **Battery Efficiency**: Minimal background processing

## Backend Dependencies

**Required APIs** (from BETA agent):
```
POST   /tasks/{client_id}              # Create task
PUT    /tasks/{client_id}/{task_id}    # Update task status  
GET    /tasks/{client_id}              # List tasks with status
DELETE /tasks/{client_id}/{task_id}    # Delete task
```

**WebSocket Events**:
- `task_created` - New task added
- `task_updated` - Task status changed
- `task_deleted` - Task removed
- `task_approved` - Task approved by user

## Data Models

**Task Model**:
```swift
struct Task: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: String
    let title: String
    let description: String
    let status: TaskStatus
    let priority: TaskPriority
    let confidence: Double
    let createdAt: Date
    let updatedAt: Date
    let assignee: String?
    let dueDate: Date?
}
```

**Kanban Column Configuration**:
```swift
enum TaskStatus: String, CaseIterable {
    case backlog = "backlog"
    case inProgress = "in_progress"
    case testing = "testing"
    case done = "done"
}
```

## Integration with Dashboard

**Navigation Integration**:
- Accessible from Projects dashboard
- Deep linking to specific project boards
- Tab integration or modal presentation
- Search and filter capabilities

## Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests**:
- Task model validation
- Drag-and-drop logic
- WebSocket event handling
- State management

**Integration Tests**:
- Backend API integration
- Real-time update handling
- Cross-device synchronization

**UI Tests**:
