## Mission Brief

You are the **Backend API Enhancement Specialist** responsible for building the server-side infrastructure that supports the iOS dashboard and advanced features across all phases of the enhancement plan.

## Context

- **Current Backend**: Basic WebSocket communication and session management
- **Target Enhancement**: Comprehensive APIs for iOS dashboard, task management, voice commands, and push notifications
- **Working Directory**: `../leanvibe-backend-apis`
- **Integration Target**: Main backend at `leanvibe-backend/`

## Phase Coverage

Your APIs will support **ALL PHASES** of the iOS enhancement plan:
- **Phase 1-2**: Project discovery and dashboard metrics
- **Phase 3**: Task management and Kanban board
- **Phase 5**: Voice command processing
- **Phase 7**: Push notification system

## Specific Tasks

### Phase 1: Enhanced Metrics APIs
**Priority**: HIGH - Supports dashboard foundation

**New Endpoints Required**:
```python
GET    /metrics/{client_id}/detailed   # Comprehensive metrics
GET    /metrics/{client_id}/history    # Historical data  
GET    /decisions/{client_id}          # Decision log with reasoning
```

**Features**:
- AI-powered analytics for project metrics
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Quality analytics and user engagement tracking
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates

### Phase 2: Task Management APIs
**Priority**: HIGH - Supports Kanban board system

**New Endpoints Required**:
```python
POST   /tasks/{client_id}              # Create task
PUT    /tasks/{client_id}/{task_id}    # Update task status  
GET    /tasks/{client_id}              # List tasks with status
DELETE /tasks/{client_id}/{task_id}    # Delete task
```

**Features**:
- Real-time task status updates via WebSocket
- Task approval/rejection workflows
- Integration with existing session management

### Phase 3: Voice Command APIs
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Supports voice interface

**New Endpoints Required**:
```python
POST   /voice/{client_id}/command      # Process voice commands
GET    /voice/commands                 # List available commands
```

**Features**:
- Natural language command processing
- Voice command pattern matching and parameter extraction
- Integration with existing command routing system

### Phase 4: Push Notification APIs
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Supports iOS notifications

**New Endpoints Required**:
```python
POST   /notifications/register         # Register device for push
GET    /notifications/{client_id}/preferences # Notification settings
PUT    /notifications/{client_id}/preferences # Update settings
```

**Features**:
- APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) integration
- Notification templates and preferences
- Real-time event-driven notifications
