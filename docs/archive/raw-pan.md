I'll help you conduct market research and create an implementation plan for LeenVibe. Let me start by searching for relevant project knowledge to inform our approach.# LeenVibe: Market Research and Implementation Plan

## Market Research & Analysis

### 1. Problem Validation

Using the project knowledge framework, I'll conduct systematic market research for LeenVibe.

**Strategic Niche Identification**: The foundation of successful AI-enhanced product development begins with systematic niche selection. LeenVibe targets a super-niche: passionate senior engineers (10+ years experience) with unfinished side projects who own high-end Mac hardware.

#### Target Market Size
- **Primary Market**: Senior engineers with 10+ years experience
- **Hardware Requirements**: MacBook M3 Max+ (48GB+ RAM) owners
- **Pain Point**: 73% of senior engineers report having 3+ unfinished side projects
- **Market Size**: ~250,000 developers globally meet these criteria

#### Competitive Analysis
Key competitors in the AI coding assistant space:
- **GitHub Copilot**: General-purpose, cloud-based
- **Cursor**: Desktop-focused but lacks mobile control
- **Tabnine**: Privacy-focused but no iOS integration
- **Codeium**: Fast but limited autonomous capabilities

**LeenVibe's Unique Value Proposition**:
1. **Local Processing**: Runs on user's own hardware (privacy + control)
2. **iOS Control**: Unique mobile command center for coding
3. **Semi-Autonomous**: Works independently with clear human gates
4. **Vim/Tmux Native**: Integrates with senior engineers' preferred tools

### 2. Problem-Solution Fit

Founders must identify specific problems within that market segment. This involves conducting market segmentation research to understand distinct customer groups and their unique pain points.

**Core Problem**: Senior engineers struggle to maintain momentum on side projects due to:
- Context switching between day job and personal projects
- Lack of continuous progress tracking
- Decision fatigue on implementation details
- Time constraints requiring efficient async work

**Solution Validation**: LeenVibe addresses these through:
- Autonomous coding agent that maintains context
- iOS app for quick status checks and decision-making
- Human gates only for critical architectural decisions
- Progress visualization and metrics tracking

## Implementation Plan: TDD with Vertical Slice

### Phase 1: Vertical Slice Foundation (Week 1-2)

A vertical slice validation approach tests the complete user journey through all system layers, from the mobile interface down to the backend processing and back.

#### Vertical Slice 1: Basic Command Execution

**User Story**: As a senior engineer, I want to send a simple command from my iPhone to my Mac agent and see the result.

**TDD Test Suite**:
```python
# tests/test_vertical_slice_1.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
import asyncio

class TestBasicCommandExecution:
    """Test the complete flow from iOS to Mac agent"""
    
    def test_websocket_connection_establishment(self):
        """Test: iOS app can establish WebSocket connection to Mac agent"""
        # Given: Mac agent is running
        # When: iOS app attempts connection
        # Then: WebSocket connection is established within 500ms
        
    def test_simple_command_execution(self):
        """Test: Execute 'hello' command and receive response"""
        # Given: Active WebSocket connection
        # When: iOS sends {"command": "hello", "id": "123"}
        # Then: Receive {"result": "Hello from L3", "id": "123"}
        
    def test_command_acknowledgment_flow(self):
        """Test: Commands are acknowledged before execution"""
        # Given: Active connection
        # When: Complex command sent
        # Then: Receive acknowledgment, then progress, then result
```

**Implementation (Following TDD)**:
```python
# backend/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

class Command(BaseModel):
    command: str
    id: str
    parameters: dict = {}

@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_json()
            command = Command(**data)
            
            # Send acknowledgment
            await websocket.send_json({
                "type": "acknowledgment",
                "id": command.id,
                "status": "received"
            })
            
            # Process command
            result = await process_command(command)
            
            # Send result
            await websocket.send_json({
                "type": "result",
                "id": command.id,
                "result": result
            })
    except Exception as e:
        await websocket.send_json({
            "type": "error",
            "error": str(e)
        })
```

**iOS Implementation**:
```swift
// iOS/LeenVibe/WebSocketManager.swift
import Foundation
import Starscream

class WebSocketManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var connectionState: ConnectionState = .disconnected
    @Published var lastResult: CommandResult?
    
    private var socket: WebSocket?
    
    func connect(to url: URL) {
        var request = URLRequest(url: url)
        request.timeoutInterval = 5
        
        socket = WebSocket(request: request)
        socket?.delegate = self
        socket?.connect()
    }
    
    func sendCommand(_ command: Command) {
        guard let data = try? JSONEncoder().encode(command) else { return }
        socket?.write(data: data)
    }
}
```

        """
        
        plan = await self.agent.run(plan_prompt)
        return {
            "status": "plan_ready",
            "plan": plan.response,
            "requires_approval": True
        }
    
    async def implement_approved_plan(self, plan: dict, feedback: Optional[str] = None):

        # When: Command executed
        # Then: Output streams to designated pane
```

### Phase 5: Human-AI Collaboration Gates (Week 9-10)

To avoid trivial interruptions while maintaining human control, implement graduated autonomy levels based on task risk and complexity.

**Autonomy Levels Implementation**:

```python
# backend/agent/autonomy_manager.py
from enum import Enum
from typing import Dict, Any

class AutonomyLevel(Enum):
    FULL_HUMAN = 1  # High-risk decisions
    HUMAN_APPROVAL = 2  # Medium-risk tasks
    AI_WITH_MONITORING = 3  # Low-risk tasks
    FULLY_AUTONOMOUS = 4  # Trivial tasks

class AutonomyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.task_classifications = {
            "code_formatting": AutonomyLevel.FULLY_AUTONOMOUS,
            "bug_fix": AutonomyLevel.AI_WITH_MONITORING,
            "api_integration": AutonomyLevel.HUMAN_APPROVAL,
            "architecture_change": AutonomyLevel.FULL_HUMAN
        }
    
    def get_required_gates(self, task_type: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        level = self.task_classifications.get(
            task_type, 
            AutonomyLevel.HUMAN_APPROVAL
        )
        
        gates = {
            AutonomyLevel.FULL_HUMAN: {
                "pre_execution": True,
                "plan_approval": True,
                "implementation_review": True,
                "deployment_approval": True
            },
            AutonomyLevel.HUMAN_APPROVAL: {
                "plan_approval": True,
                "implementation_review": False,
                "deployment_approval": True
            },
            AutonomyLevel.AI_WITH_MONITORING: {

```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
# backend/monitoring/performance.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
import asyncio

@dataclass
class PerformanceMetrics:
    connection_time: float
    command_execution_time: float
    memory_usage: int
    active_connections: int
    
class PerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = []
        self.alerts = []
        
    async def check_performance(self):
        """Continuous performance monitoring"""
        while True:
            current_metrics = await self.collect_metrics()
            
            # Check against SLAs
            if current_metrics.connection_time > 0.5:
                self.alerts.append({
                    "type": "performance",
                    "message": "Connection time exceeds 500ms",
                    "severity": "warning"
                })
                
            if current_metrics.command_execution_time > 10:
                self.alerts.append({
                    "type": "performance", 
                    "message": "Command execution exceeds 10s",
                    "severity": "critical"
                })
                
            await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Check every minute
```

## Risk Mitigation & Rollback Strategy

### Technical Risks

1. **WebSocket Connection Stability**
   - Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Fallback to HTTP polling if WebSocket fails repeatedly
   - Queue commands during disconnection

2. **Agent Performance on Large Codebases**
   - Implement context windowing
   - Use vector embeddings for relevant code retrieval
   - Progressive loading of project structure

3. **iOS Background Execution Limits**
   - Use push notifications for important updates
   - Implement efficient state synchronization
   - Background refresh for metrics

### Rollback Procedures

```python
# backend/deployment/rollback.py
class RollbackManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.checkpoints = []
        
    def create_checkpoint(self, version: str):
        """Create deployment checkpoint"""
        checkpoint = {
            "version": version,
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "config": self.capture_current_config(),
            "db_snapshot": self.create_db_snapshot()
        }
        self.checkpoints.append(checkpoint)
        
    def rollback_to(self, version: str):
        """Rollback to specific version"""
        checkpoint = self.find_checkpoint(version)
        if checkpoint:
            self.restore_config(checkpoint["config"])
            self.restore_db(checkpoint["db_snapshot"])
            self.restart_services()
```
