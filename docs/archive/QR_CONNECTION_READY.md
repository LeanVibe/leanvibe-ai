# ðŸŽ¯ LeanVibe QR Connection - Ready for Testing!

## âœ… System Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The QR code connection system is complete and ready for end-to-end testing.

## ðŸš€ How to Test (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start Backend with QR Code
```bash
cd /Users/bogdan/work/leanvibe-ai/leanvibe-backend
./start.sh
```
You'll see:
- ðŸ“¡ Network interfaces detected
- ðŸ“± ASCII QR code displayed
- âœ… Server ready message

### Step 2: Deploy iOS App to Device
```bash
# Open Xcode project
open /Users/bogdan/work/leanvibe-ai/LeanVibe-iOS-App/LeanVibe.xcodeproj

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select your physical iOS device (not simulator)
# 2. Set your Development Team in Signing & Capabilities
# 3. Press Cmd+R to build and run
```

### Step 3: Connect via QR Code
1. **Open app** on your iOS device
2. **Tap "Scan QR"** button (with QR code icon)
3. **Point camera** at the QR code in your terminal
4. **Wait for auto-connection** (should happen instantly)
5. **See "Connected" status** in the app

### Step 4: Test Communication
1. **Try quick commands**: Tap `/status`, `/help`, `/list-files`
2. **Send custom message**: Type "Hello agent" and send
3. **Verify responses**: Should see agent replies in chat
