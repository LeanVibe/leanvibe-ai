## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

### High Risk Scenarios

#### 1. Feature Loss During Migration
**Risk**: Consolidated service missing features from deprecated services  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (broken user workflows)

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive feature audit before migration
- Feature-by-feature validation testing
- Rollback plan if features missing

**Detection**:
```bash
# Before migration
python scripts/test_all_voice_features.py > features_before.txt

# After migration  
python scripts/test_all_voice_features.py > features_after.txt

# Validation
diff features_before.txt features_after.txt
# Should show no missing features
```

#### 2. Performance Regression
**Risk**: Consolidated services slower than originals  
**Probability**: Low  
**Impact**: High (user experience degradation)

**Mitigation**:
- Performance baseline before migration
- Benchmarking after each consolidation phase
- Performance budget enforcement

**Detection**:
```bash
# Performance must stay within 10% of baseline
if response_time > baseline * 1.1:
    rollback_migration()
```

#### 3. Integration Breakage
**Risk**: UI components fail with consolidated services  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (app crashes, unusable features)

**Mitigation**:
- Gradual UI migration with testing at each step
- Integration test suite execution after each change
- Feature flags to enable/disable consolidated services

### Medium Risk Scenarios

#### 1. Configuration Complexity
**Risk**: Service selection logic becomes too complex  
**Impact**: Medium (developer confusion)

**Mitigation**: Simple environment-based selection only

#### 2. Dependency Issues  
**Risk**: Services depend on deprecated services
**Impact**: Medium (build failures)

**Mitigation**: Dependency mapping before deletion

### Risk Monitoring

#### Daily Risk Assessment:
```bash
# Run after each day's changes
python scripts/risk_assessment.py --phase=[current_phase]

# Outputs:
# - Feature parity check
# - Performance regression check  
# - Integration health check
# - Test coverage check
```

#### Rollback Triggers:
- Any feature stops working
- Performance degrades >10%
- Test coverage drops >5%
- Integration tests fail
- Production health checks fail
