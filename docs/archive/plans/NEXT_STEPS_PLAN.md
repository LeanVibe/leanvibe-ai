### **Week 1: End-to-End Validation**

#### **Priority 1: Complete Service Stack Validation**
```bash
# Task 1.1: Start Ollama service and validate full stack
ollama serve &
ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct

# Task 1.2: Run comprehensive health check
leanvibe health --detailed --timeout 30

# Task 1.3: Execute MVP core journey tests
cd leanvibe-backend
python tests/test_mvp_core_journey.py

# Task 1.4: Validate iOS-Backend integration
# Start backend, connect iOS app, test real queries
```

#### **Priority 2: Performance Benchmarking**
- [ ] Measure actual query response times under load
- [ ] Validate <10s target with various query types

- [ ] Create user testing scenarios for MVP core journey
- [ ] Set up monitoring for user session analytics
- [ ] Prepare feedback collection mechanisms
- [ ] Document known limitations and workarounds

#### **Priority 2: Production Readiness**
- [ ] Review security implications for local deployment
- [ ] Validate privacy compliance (no external data transmission)
- [ ] Test on different development environments
- [ ] Create deployment guides for end users

#### **Priority 3: Quality Assurance**
- [ ] Code review for production readiness
- [ ] Security audit of API endpoints
- [ ] Performance profiling under realistic workloads
- [ ] Documentation completeness review

### **Week 3: Launch Preparation**

#### **Priority 1: Final Polish**
- [ ] Fix any critical issues found in user testing
- [ ] Optimize user experience based on feedback
- [ ] Complete documentation for end users
- [ ] Prepare release notes and migration guides

#### **Priority 2: Launch Infrastructure**
- [ ] Create installation packages/scripts
- [ ] Set up user support infrastructure
- [ ] Prepare troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Plan feedback collection and iteration cycles

## 🔄 **Phase 3: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)**

### **Month 1 Post-Launch: Core Stability**
- Monitor real usage patterns and performance
- Address critical bugs and user friction points
- Optimize based on actual usage data
- Plan next feature priorities based on user feedback

### **Month 2-3: Feature Enhancement**
- Voice interface improvements (if validated as valuable)
- Enhanced error recovery and user guidance
- Performance optimizations based on usage patterns
- Integration improvements with popular development tools

## 📋 **Immediate Action Items (Next 48 Hours)**

### **Critical Path Tasks**
1. **Start Ollama Service**: `ollama serve` and pull Mistral 7B model
2. **Run Health Check**: `leanvibe health --detailed` to validate full stack
3. **Execute MVP Tests**: Run `test_mvp_core_journey.py` end-to-end
4. **Test iOS Integration**: Connect iOS app to backend and test queries
5. **Document Any Issues**: Create tickets for any failures or performance gaps

### **Documentation Updates**
1. **Update AGENTS.md**: Reflect completed MVP foundation work
2. **Update README.md**: Add health check instructions and usage examples
3. **Create USER_GUIDE.md**: Step-by-step setup and usage instructions
4. **Update TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Common issues and resolutions

### **Validation Criteria**
- [ ] Health check shows all services as "healthy"
- [ ] MVP test suite passes with <10s response times
- [ ] iOS app successfully connects and processes queries
- [ ] No critical performance or reliability issues

## 🎯 **Success Metrics for Phase 2**

### **Technical Metrics**
- **Query Response Time**: <10s for 95% of queries
- **System Uptime**: >99% availability during testing
- **Error Rate**: <5% of queries fail
- **Reconnection Success**: >95% success rate for network recovery

### **User Experience Metrics**
- **Setup Time**: <15 minutes from download to first query
- **User Success Rate**: >80% complete the core journey successfully
- **User Satisfaction**: >4/5 rating for core functionality
- **Support Requests**: <10% of users need help beyond documentation

## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Ollama Service Issues**: Prepare fallback AI services if needed
- **iOS WebSocket Problems**: Create debugging tools and detailed logs
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor and have optimization strategies ready
- **Concurrency Issues**: Test and validate multi-user scenarios

### **User Experience Risks**
- **Complex Setup**: Create automated setup scripts
- **Poor Error Messages**: Improve error handling and user guidance
- **Feature Confusion**: Focus on core journey, defer advanced features
- **Documentation Gaps**: Comprehensive user testing of documentation
