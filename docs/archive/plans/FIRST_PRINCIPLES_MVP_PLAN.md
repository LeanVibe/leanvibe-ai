# 🎯 LeanVibe First Principles MVP Plan

**Date**: July 10, 2025  
**Approach**: First principles thinking, not feature counting  
**Core Finding**: 0% MVP-ready despite excellent architecture  

## 🔍 First Principles Analysis

### Fundamental Truth: MVP = Proof of Core Value to Real Users

**Core User Need**: Get AI help with code locally (privacy-first)  
**Essential User Journey**: Ask question → Get useful answer in <10s → Privacy maintained  

**Current Reality**:
- ❌ Step 1: Question routing works but times out  
- ❌ Step 2: 60-90s responses vs. expected <10s  
- ❌ Step 3: No end-to-end validation  

**Conclusion**: Excellent components, zero validated user value delivery.

## 🚀 6-Week First Principles Implementation

### Phase 1: Prove Core Value (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: One working user journey: "Developer asks question → gets AI answer in <10s"

#### Week 1: Fix Performance Foundation
```bash
# Priority 1: Switch to fast AI model
# Replace DeepSeek R1 32B (60s) → Mistral 7B (<5s)
cd leanvibe-backend/app/services
# Update ollama_ai_service.py default_model = "mistral:7b-instruct"

# Priority 2: Create real end-to-end test
cd leanvibe-backend/tests
# Create test_mvp_core_journey.py - real CLI → Backend → AI → Response
```

#### Week 2: Validate Core Journey
```bash
# Test scenario: "Explain this Python function"
leanvibe query "What does the main() function do in app.py?"
# Expected: <10s response with actual code analysis

# Success criteria:
# ✅ Response time <10s
# ✅ Actual AI analysis (not timeout)
# ✅ CLI displays formatted response
```

### Phase 2: Reliability (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Core journey works consistently with proper error handling

#### Week 3: Connection Reality
```bash
# Add real health diagnostics
leanvibe health --detailed
# Should show: HTTP ✅, WebSocket ✅, L3 Agent ✅, Ollama ✅

# Fix connection validation in iOS
# Replace mocked testConnection() with real WebSocket test
```

#### Week 4: Error Recovery
```bash
# When things break, users know why and how to fix
# Add specific error messages:
# "Backend starting (estimated 30s)" vs "Connection failed"
# "AI model loading" vs "Service unavailable"
```

### Phase 3: MVP Polish (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Production-ready core journey

#### Week 5: Performance Optimization
```bash
# Optimize what matters for core journey
# - L3 agent warm startup (<5s)
# - Query routing optimization
# - Response formatting speed
```

#### Week 6: Privacy Validation
```bash
# Validate core privacy claims
# - No network calls during AI processing
# - Local data verification
# - Privacy audit of data flows
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics (First Principles)

### Core Value Metrics
- **Query Success Rate**: >95% of queries get useful responses
- **Response Time**: <10s for typical development questions
- **Privacy Validation**: Zero external data transmission during AI processing

### User Journey Metrics
- **Setup Time**: Developer can ask first question within 5 minutes
- **Answer Quality**: AI provides actionable code insights
- **Reliability**: Same query gives consistent results

## 🚫 What We're NOT Building (Until Core Works)

- Voice interfaces ("Hey LeanVibe")
- iOS mobile app features
- Kanban task management
- Advanced WebSocket features  
- Architecture visualization
- Multiple AI model support
- Real-time collaboration

**Rationale**: These are enhancements to core value, not core value itself.

## 🔄 Weekly Validation Protocol

**Every Friday**: Test core user journey with fresh perspective
1. Reset environment completely
2. Follow new user setup process
3. Ask realistic coding question
4. Measure time to useful answer
5. Document any friction points

**Decision Rule**: If core journey doesn't work perfectly by end of each phase, continue that phase until it does.

## 🎉 MVP Launch Criteria

**Core Value Proven**:
- [ ] Developer can ask code questions in natural language
- [ ] AI provides useful answers in <10s consistently  
- [ ] Privacy maintained (verified local processing)
- [ ] Setup process takes <5 minutes
- [ ] Works reliably across different codebases

**When these 5 criteria are met → MVP launch ready**

---

**Key Insight**: This plan focuses on proving ONE thing works perfectly rather than building MANY things that don't work together.

**Timeline**: 6 weeks to validate core value vs. 6+ months to fix current feature-heavy approach.
