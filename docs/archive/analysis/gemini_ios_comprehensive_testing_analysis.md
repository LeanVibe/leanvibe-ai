## Analysis Framework: First Principles Approach

Apply first principles thinking to identify fundamental issues:

### 1. Core User Journey Stability
**Fundamental Truth**: MVP success depends on core user flows working reliably
**Questions to Answer**:
- Which user journeys from onboarding → dashboard → key features are most fragile?
- What are the highest-risk failure points that would block user adoption?
- Which SwiftUI state management patterns are prone to bugs in production?

### 2. Technical Debt Assessment
**Fundamental Truth**: Technical debt compounds exponentially and blocks velocity
**Analyze for**:
- **Incomplete Implementations**: Features started but not production-ready
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Multiple ways of doing the same thing across the codebase
- **Missing Error Handling**: Happy path implementations without proper error states
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: UI rendering issues, memory leaks, inefficient data flow
- **Integration Gaps**: Backend communication, WebSocket reliability, notification handling

### 3. Testing Coverage Gaps (Pareto Analysis)
**Fundamental Truth**: 20% of tests prevent 80% of production issues
**Identify**:
- **Critical Untested Paths**: Core business logic without test coverage
- **Integration Points**: Backend API calls, WebSocket events, notification flows
- **State Management**: Complex ViewModels and data flow patterns
- **UI Critical Paths**: Navigation, form validation, error handling
- **Performance Regressions**: Memory usage, rendering performance, battery optimization

## Specific Analysis Targets

### Architecture & Integration Analysis
Based on ALPHA/GAMMA/KAPPA work, evaluate:

#### 1. Dashboard Foundation (ALPHA)
- Are project cards, navigation, and metrics display production-ready?
- What error states are missing for backend communication failures?
- How robust is the WebSocket integration for real-time updates?

#### 2. Architecture Viewer (GAMMA/KAPPA)
- Is the Mermaid rendering stable across different diagram sizes?
- Are there memory leaks with large architecture visualizations?
- How does performance degrade with complex project structures?

#### 3. Kanban Board System (KAPPA)
- Is drag-and-drop functionality robust across different iOS versions?
- Are task state transitions properly validated and error-handled?
- How reliable is the real-time synchronization with backend?

#### 4. Voice Interface (KAPPA)
- Are speech recognition permissions properly handled?
- What happens when network connectivity is poor during voice commands?
- Is there proper fallback when voice processing fails?

#### 5. Onboarding & Tutorial System (GAMMA)
- Can users recover from interrupted onboarding flows?
- Are tutorial states properly persisted across app restarts?
- How robust is the QR code scanning for backend connection?

#### 6. Settings & Configuration (KAPPA)
- Are settings properly validated and persisted?
- What happens with invalid configuration states?
- How reliable is the notification permission management?

## Analysis Methodology

### Code Pattern Analysis
Look for these anti-patterns and opportunities:
- **Force unwrapping** without proper nil handling
- **Synchronous network calls** blocking the UI thread
- **Memory retain cycles** in closures and delegates
- **Inconsistent error handling** across similar components
- **Hard-coded values** that should be configurable
- **Missing input validation** on user forms
- **Inefficient SwiftUI updates** causing performance issues

### Integration Robustness
Evaluate these critical integration points:
- **WebSocket reconnection logic** and state recovery
- **Backend API error handling** and retry mechanisms
- **Push notification reliability** and permission management
- **QR code scanning robustness** across lighting conditions
- **Voice command processing** error handling
- **Settings persistence** and migration handling

### Performance & Production Readiness
Assess these production concerns:
- **Memory usage patterns** during heavy usage
- **Battery optimization** for background operations
- **Network efficiency** for poor connectivity scenarios
- **Rendering performance** with large datasets
- **App launch time** and first-load user experience

## Technical Constraints & Requirements

### Testing Framework Preferences:
- **XCTest** for unit and integration tests
- **ViewInspector** for SwiftUI view testing
- **Quick/Nimble** for BDD-style testing if beneficial
- **UI Testing** for critical user flows only (avoid brittle tests)

### Performance Benchmarks:
- **App launch time**: <3 seconds cold start
- **View rendering**: <100ms for standard views
- **Network requests**: <5 seconds with proper loading states
- **Memory usage**: <200MB for normal operation
- **Battery optimization**: Minimal background drain

### MVP Launch Criteria:
- **Core user journey**: 100% functional without crashes
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation for all failure modes
- **Performance**: Meets App Store guidelines
- **Accessibility**: Basic VoiceOver support
- **Documentation**: Deployment and troubleshooting guides
