curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Dependencies not installed
uv sync

# Port already in use
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```

### iOS Issues
```bash
# Package dependencies not resolved
swift package update

# Build cache issues
# In Xcode: Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)

# Missing Starscream
# In Xcode: File → Packages → Update to Latest Package Versions
```
