# LeanVibe L3 Coding Agent: High-Fidelity Mockups

## Complete Visual System Design

I've created a comprehensive set of high-fidelity mockups for LeanVibe, showcasing the complete L3 autonomous coding agent platform that combines Mac CLI integration with an iOS companion app. These mockups demonstrate the Football Manager-inspired UI aesthetics, Liquid Glass design language, and seamless cross-platform workflow that defines the LeanVibe experience.

## iOS Mobile Experience

### Dashboard \& Task Management

The iOS dashboard serves as the central command center, featuring a Football Manager-inspired tactical board approach to coding task management. The interface displays active coding tasks as interactive cards with real-time status indicators, CPU/RAM usage visualization through color-coded stamina bars, and swipe-based task reprioritization capabilities.

The dashboard implements Apple's Liquid Glass design principles with translucent panels that provide depth while maintaining excellent readability. Task cards show confidence scores, progress indicators, and priority levels using the established color palette of blues, greens, and warning oranges.

### Kanban Task Organization

The kanban board transforms traditional project management into an engaging, game-like experience reminiscent of Football Manager's squad management screens. Tasks flow through customizable columns (Todo, In Progress, Review, Done) with drag-and-drop physics animations and visual feedback.

Each task card displays essential information including difficulty estimates, agent confidence levels, and completion percentages. The interface supports multi-touch gestures for rapid task reorganization and batch operations.

### Architecture Visualization

The architecture viewer provides developers with interactive Mermaid.js diagrams that render code dependencies as navigable blueprints. The interface supports zoom, pan, and tap-to-inspect operations while highlighting recent changes through visual diff indicators.

The blueprint aesthetic uses neon connection lines against dark backgrounds, creating a technical yet approachable visualization of complex code relationships. Component details appear in floating Liquid Glass panels that provide context without obscuring the main diagram.

### Voice Interaction System

The voice command interface demonstrates LeanVibe's hands-free capabilities through an elegant waveform visualization that rises from a translucent bottom sheet. Real-time audio processing indicators provide immediate feedback during voice interactions.

The system supports wake phrase detection ("Hey LeanVibe") with on-device processing, maintaining privacy while enabling natural language commands for all critical functions.

### Human Gate Review Process

The human gate review interface enables developers to make informed decisions about AI agent proposals through side-by-side code diffs and comprehensive confidence metrics. The Football Manager-inspired decision interface presents approve, modify, and reject options with clear visual hierarchy.

This critical interaction point ensures human oversight remains central to the L3 agent workflow while streamlining the decision-making process through intelligent presentation of relevant context.

## Mac CLI Integration

### Terminal Interface Design

The Mac CLI showcases deep integration with vim and tmux workflows, featuring a cyber-minimal aesthetic that respects developer preferences while adding intelligent assistance. The interface displays agent suggestions in dedicated panes with clear confidence indicators and minimal visual disruption.

The terminal implementation uses SF Mono typography with carefully chosen syntax highlighting that maintains readability while providing semantic information about agent-generated content.

### Device Pairing System

The QR pairing interface demonstrates the seamless connection process between Mac and iOS devices. The terminal displays a prominently featured QR code with glowing neon borders that maintain the cyberpunk aesthetic while ensuring reliable scanning.

The pairing process establishes secure, encrypted communication channels that enable real-time synchronization between the CLI agent and mobile monitoring interface.

## Onboarding \& Setup Experience

### iOS Welcome Flow

The onboarding experience introduces users to LeanVibe's unique value proposition through clean, privacy-focused messaging. The welcome screen emphasizes the "AI Co-Founder" concept while maintaining Apple's design standards.

- **Typography**: SF Mono for terminal interfaces, SF Pro Text for mobile
- **Interaction Patterns**: Liquid Glass depth effects, Football Manager-inspired card layouts, confidence-based visual feedback


### Cross-Platform Harmony

The mockups showcase seamless integration between Mac CLI and iOS mobile experiences, with shared visual languages and synchronized state management. Real-time updates flow between platforms while respecting each environment's interaction paradigms.

### Accessibility \& Usability

Each interface prioritizes accessibility through high contrast ratios, appropriate touch targets, and alternative interaction methods. The voice interface provides hands-free operation while visual indicators ensure information remains accessible to all users.

These high-fidelity mockups provide a complete visual foundation for implementing LeanVibe's innovative approach to autonomous coding assistance, demonstrating how advanced AI capabilities can be made accessible through thoughtful interface design and cross-platform integration.
