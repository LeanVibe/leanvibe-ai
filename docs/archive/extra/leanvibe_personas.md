Customer Personas ‚Äì LeanVibe (privacy-first autonomous coding agent for senior indie Apple developers)

‚∏ª

üë§ Persona #1 ‚Äì ‚ÄúSam Nguyen, The After-Hours Side-Hustler‚Äù

Attribute	Details
Demographics / Firmographics	34-year-old Staff iOS engineer at a FAANG company, lives in Austin TX, earns $230 k salary, owns MacBook Pro M3 Max (64 GB RAM) & iPhone 15 Pro Max.
Day-in-the-Life Problem Snapshot	9-to-5 day job; 8-11 pm works on a niche SaaS side-project. Spends >45 min each night just re-loading context & fixing dev-env issues before adding new code. No teammate to sanity-check architecture, progress stalls for weeks. e Analysis_ AI-Enhanced Developer Tools.md](file-service://file-AerN6SptTAcXjTCa5k61st)
Current Solution & Limitations	Uses GitHub Copilot in VS Code + Trello board. Limitations: cloud AI (IP exposure), no CLI/vim support, zero visibility while away from desk, cannot run offline flights-mode. 78 % of devs share privacy worries with cloud AI ‚Äì Sam is one of them. Analysis_ AI-Enhanced Developer Tools.md](file-service://file-AerN6SptTAcXjTCa5k61st)
Decision Criteria	‚Ä¢ Runs 100 % locally ‚Ä¢ Works in vim/tmux ‚Ä¢ iOS dashboard for builds ‚Ä¢ One-time or low monthly cost ‚Ä¢ Clear rollback / git commits
Budget / Authority	Personal budget ‚âà $30‚Äì50 / mo; sole decision-maker.
Jobs-to-Be-Done	Functional: accelerate nightly coding, auto-run tests, keep project on track. Emotional: regain momentum, feel ‚Äúprofessional not hobbyist,‚Äù ship before losing motivation.

Attribute	Details
Demographics / Firmographics	40-year-old freelance solutions architect; contracts with fintech & health-tech SMEs (3‚Äì10 dev teams); works remotely from Toronto; uses two Apple Silicon machines for client projects.
Day-in-the-Life Problem Snapshot	Juggles 3 codebases under strict NDAs. Cloud AI tools are banned by clients; debugging legacy Swift & Python code is solo labour. Context-switch cost tanks billable efficiency. Analysis_ AI-Enhanced Developer Tools.md](file-service://file-AerN6SptTAcXjTCa5k61st)
Current Solution & Limitations	Manual grep + Dash docs; occasional offline LLM via terminal but slow/inaccurate. No unified view across repos, no mobile insights during client calls.
Decision Criteria	‚Ä¢ On-prem / offline only ‚Ä¢ Auditable logs for compliance ‚Ä¢ Multi-repo knowledge base ‚Ä¢ Fixed-fee license to expense to clients.
Budget / Authority	Bills $180 /hr; can expense up to $2 k / year per tooling; self-decides.
Jobs-to-Be-Done	Functional: cut debug hours, auto-generate compliance-ready docs. Emotional: look expert & trustworthy in front of risk-averse clients.

Attribute	Details
Demographics / Firmographics	45-year-old principal engineer at mid-size manufacturing firm (250 employees); manages 3-person dev team modernising Objective-C & COBOL services to Swift & Rust.
Day-in-the-Life Problem Snapshot	Swaps between factory floor issues and refactor tasks. Autonomous task execution & mobile monitoring don‚Äôt exist today, leaving long refactor jobs unchecked overnight. Analysis_ AI-Enhanced Developer Tools.md](file-service://file-AerN6SptTAcXjTCa5k61st)
Current Solution & Limitations	Scripts + Jenkins; trials Tabnine Enterprise (local) but lacks autonomy & Apple optimisation. Needs agent that can plan, refactor, and alert on phone.
Decision Criteria	‚Ä¢ Proven Apple Silicon performance ‚Ä¢ Handles multi-language legacy stacks ‚Ä¢ Visual architecture diffs ‚Ä¢ Procurement-friendly perpetual license (<$15 k).
Budget / Authority	Controls $50 k annual tooling budget; can pilot new software for team.
Jobs-to-Be-Done	Functional: automate bulk refactors & track progress remotely. Emotional: relief from tech-debt burden, credibility for modernising stack.
