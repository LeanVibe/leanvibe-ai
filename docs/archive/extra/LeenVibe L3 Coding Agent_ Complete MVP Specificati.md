# LeenVibe L3 Coding Agent: Complete MVP Specification

## Executive Summary

LeenVibe delivers a groundbreaking L3 autonomous coding agent designed specifically for senior engineers working on side projects using Apple Silicon hardware [^1]. The system empowers developers to finalize their dream projects by providing intelligent coding assistance that runs entirely on local hardware without cloud dependencies.

This specification document outlines the complete architecture, features, implementation roadmap, and deployment strategy for the LeenVibe MVP [^2].

LeenVibe System Architecture

## Product Vision \& Target Users

The core vision of LeenVibe is to create a semi-autonomous coding agent that operates locally on developers' machines while providing mobile monitoring and control capabilities [^3]. Target users are senior engineers with Apple Silicon Macs (M3 Max or better with 48GB+ RAM) and iOS devices (iPhone 14 Pro or better) who value privacy, efficiency, and seamless workflow integration [^4]. The product differentiates itself through deep integration with development workflows like vim+tmux, architecture visualization, and human-in-the-loop confidence gates [^5].

## System Architecture

The LeenVibe system consists of two primary components that work together to deliver the L3 agent experience: the Mac backend and the iOS mobile client [^6]. The Mac backend handles the heavy computational tasks including LLM inference, code analysis, and state management, while the iOS client provides monitoring, visualization, and voice control capabilities [^7].

### Mac Backend Components

The backend leverages several key technologies optimized for Apple Silicon [^8]:

1. **MLX-LM Engine**: Utilizes Qwen2.5-Coder-32B model optimized for Apple Silicon, capable of running on M3 Max with 48GB unified memory while delivering excellent code understanding and generation capabilities [^9].
2. **Tree-sitter AST Parser**: Provides fast, incremental parsing of code in multiple languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C++, Java, and Swift [^10].
3. **Neo4j Graph Database**: Stores code relationships and architecture information to enable fast traversal queries and visualization data preparation [^11].
4. **Pydantic.ai Agent Framework**: Implements the L3 agent capabilities with type-safe tools, state management, confidence scoring, and decision logging [^12].
5. **FastAPI WebSocket Server**: Enables real-time bidirectional communication between the Mac backend and iOS client [^13].

### iOS Client Components

The iOS application provides a rich interface for monitoring and controlling the L3 agent [^14]:

1. **Kanban Board**: Offers visual project task management with drag-and-drop functionality, status visualization, and confidence indicators [^15].
2. **Architecture Viewer**: Renders interactive Mermaid.js diagrams of code dependencies with zoom, pan, and navigation capabilities [^16].
3. **Voice Interface**: Implements natural language voice control with wake phrase detection and command recognition [^17].
4. **Metrics Dashboard**: Displays agent performance statistics including confidence scores, decision logs, and progress metrics [^18].

## Core Features \& User Stories

The MVP focuses on three core features that deliver substantial value to senior engineers working on side projects [^19]:

### 1. Live Dependency Mapping

This feature automatically analyzes and visualizes code architecture in real-time, helping developers maintain architectural integrity [^20]. The system parses code files using Tree-sitter, extracts dependencies, stores them in Neo4j, and generates Mermaid.js diagrams that update within 2 seconds of code changes [^21].

### 2. Change Impact Analysis

The impact analysis feature identifies and alerts on the impact of code changes to other components, preventing unintended side effects [^22]. When developers modify code, the system detects changes, traverses the dependency graph to identify affected components, and generates risk assessments with mitigation suggestions [^23].

### 3. CLI and iOS Integration

LeenVibe provides seamless workflow between command-line and mobile interfaces, enabling developers to work with familiar tools while monitoring progress remotely [^24]. CLI commands mirror Claude Code CLI patterns, with state changes reflected in real-time on the iOS app, and voice commands from iOS can control CLI workflows [^25].

## Implementation Roadmap

The development plan spans 14 weeks divided into five phases [^26]:

1. **Foundation** (2 weeks): Establish the basic Mac agent with MLX-LM integration, core CLI interface, and iOS connectivity [^27].
2. **Code Analysis Engine** (3 weeks): Implement Tree-sitter integration, Neo4j setup, and real-time code monitoring [^28].
3. **L3 Agent Capabilities** (4 weeks): Develop the pydantic.ai agent framework, tool implementations, state management, and confidence scoring [^29].
4. **iOS Experience** (3 weeks): Create the Kanban board UI, architecture viewer, voice interface, and metrics dashboard [^30].
5. **Integration and Testing** (2 weeks): Conduct end-to-end testing, performance optimization, and user experience refinement [^31].

## Technical Requirements \& Security Considerations

The system requires specific hardware and software to operate effectively [^32]. The Mac backend needs an Apple Silicon Mac (M3 Max or better) with 48GB+ RAM, macOS 14.0+, and dependencies including MLX Framework, Neo4j, and FastAPI [^33]. The iOS client requires an iPhone 14 Pro or newer with iOS 17.0+ [^34].

Security is a core consideration for the LeenVibe system, with all data remaining on the user's devices and no cloud transmission [^35]. WebSocket communication uses end-to-end encryption, and the system implements device-based authentication for iOS-Mac pairing [^36]. Generated code runs in a sandboxed environment with static analysis before execution [^37].

## Conclusion

The LeenVibe L3 Coding Agent MVP specification provides a comprehensive blueprint for developing an innovative tool that empowers senior engineers to complete their side projects efficiently [^38]. By leveraging the power of Apple Silicon and state-of-the-art LLM technology, LeenVibe offers a unique combination of coding intelligence, architectural visualization, and mobile control that addresses the key pain points experienced by its target users [^39]. The phased implementation approach ensures a methodical development process with clearly defined milestones and success criteria [^40].
