# Revised LeanVibe Mockups Incorporating Initial Vision

## Core Design Principles Integration

### Football Manager Mobile UI DNA

- **Tactical Task Board**: Swipe-to-reprioritize tasks with physics-based animations
- **Agent Fitness System**: CPU/RAM usage as color-coded stamina bars
- **Match Replay**: Session playback showing agent's decision path


### Manus AI Architecture

- **Distributed Agent Network**: Planner/Coder/Verifier microservices
- **Cryptographic Attestation**: TPM-signed execution proofs
- **Self-Debugging Loop**: Autonomous error diagnosis and correction


### Liquid Glass Implementation

- Dynamic depth adaptation with context-aware translucency
- Subtle specular highlights on interactive elements
- Fluid state transitions between task states

## Key Integrations from Initial Vision

| Feature | Implementation | Benefit |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Tactical Task Management** | Football Manager position mapping | Visual priority assignment |
| **Agent Stamina System** | Color-coded CPU/RAM indicators | Prevent resource overconsumption |
| **Match Replay Debugging** | Timestamped decision scrubbing | Understand agent reasoning |
| **Cryptographic Attestation** | TPM-signed execution badges | Verify code provenance |
| **Self-Debugging Loop** | Auto-correction with >85% confidence | Reduce human intervention |

These mockups blend Football Manager's tactical visualization with Manus AI's distributed architecture while maintaining Apple's Liquid Glass design language. The implementation focuses on creating a cohesive experience where senior engineers can manage autonomous coding agents with the strategic depth of sports management games and the security of enterprise-grade systems.
