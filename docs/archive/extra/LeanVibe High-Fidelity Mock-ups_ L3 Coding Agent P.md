## Mac Terminal Experience

### First Launch Installer

The installation experience presents a cyber-aesthetic terminal interface with carefully considered typography and color choices. Progress indicators pulse in Neon Blue (\#0A84FF) against the Jet Black background, creating visual interest without sacrificing readability.

### Setup Wizard (tmux integration)

The tmux-integrated setup process demonstrates LeanVibe's commitment to existing developer workflows.

Split panes maintain context while configuring the agent, with syntax highlighting providing visual hierarchy through color.

### QR Pairing Screen

Terminal-based pairing leverages a cyber-noir aesthetic with a prominent QR code rendered with glowing borders.

The monospace interface elements maintain the developer-focused experience while providing clear visual instructions for the mobile connection process.

### Live Command Execution

The vim integration showcases LeanVibe's ability to provide contextual code suggestions alongside existing editor environments. The confidence badge in Success Green (\#32D74B) provides immediate visual feedback about the agent's certainty level.

### Subtle Agent Notification

Unobtrusive status bar notifications demonstrate LeanVibe's respect for developer focus and flow states. The minimal design ensures awareness without interruption, illuminating briefly in Neon Blue only when relevant suggestions are available.

## iOS Companion Experience

### First Launch Welcome

The iOS welcome screen introduces Apple's 2025 Liquid Glass design language with translucent, depth-adaptive elements. The privacy-focused messaging is reinforced by the SF Symbols lock icon, establishing trust from the first interaction.

### QR Scanner Pairing

The scanner interface combines camera functionality with translucent Liquid Glass overlays that provide real-time feedback during the pairing process.

The design maintains dark mode consistency while adding subtle data visualization elements that respond to the scanning process.

### Developer Dashboard

The dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of project status through Liquid Glass widgets that appear to hover above a blurred background. The circular confidence gauge and build status indicators provide at-a-glance metrics that help developers maintain awareness of project health.

### Kanban Board

Task management receives a Liquid Glass treatment with translucent columns and cards that include status-tinted glows.

The draggable cards maintain depth perception through subtle shadows and reflections, creating a tactile interaction model.

### Architecture Viewer

The Mermaid-based architecture visualization presents code relationships as an interactive blueprint with neon lines against a frosted canvas. Zoom controls utilize the Liquid Glass aesthetic to maintain design consistency while providing intuitive navigation.

### Voice Command Interface

Voice interaction is visualized through a waveform rising from a bottom Liquid Glass sheet, with real-time transcription displayed as the developer speaks.

### Human Gate Review

The decision gate interface presents code diffs under a frosted panel with clear approval options. The confidence meter helps developers make informed decisions about AI suggestions, while the Approve/Modify/Reject buttons follow the Liquid Glass design language.

## Implementation Considerations

The LeanVibe design system successfully bridges two distinct environments—terminal and mobile—while maintaining a cohesive brand identity. Key technical considerations include:

1. **Terminal Rendering** - Ensuring color accuracy and typography rendering in various terminal emulators while maintaining the cyber-aesthetic
2. **Liquid Glass Effects** - Implementing the translucency and depth effects of Apple's 2025 design language while maintaining performance on iOS devices
3. **Accessibility** - Maintaining 4.5:1 contrast ratios across all interfaces while utilizing the full color palette for semantic meaning
4. **Responsive Layouts** - Ensuring both terminal and mobile interfaces adapt appropriately to different screen sizes and orientations

The high-fidelity mock-ups demonstrate LeanVibe's potential to revolutionize how developers interact with AI coding assistants, respecting their preferred workflows while adding powerful new capabilities through thoughtful design.
