## ðŸ“‹ **Overview**

This Definition of Done (DoD) establishes comprehensive quality standards that all user stories and tasks must meet before being considered complete. It serves as a shared agreement between AI agents and human team members, ensuring consistent quality across all deliverables.

### **Purpose**
- Maintain consistent quality standards across AI and human work
- Provide clear completion criteria for all development activities
- Enable automated quality validation through integrated commands
- Support COPPA compliance and child safety requirements
- Facilitate seamless handoffs between AI and human team members

### **Scope**
- All user stories and development tasks
- Bug fixes and technical debt items
- Documentation and process improvements
- Architecture and design decisions
