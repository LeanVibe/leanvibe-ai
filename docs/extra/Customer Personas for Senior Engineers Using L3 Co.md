### Customer Personas for Senior Engineers Using L3 Coding Agents

#### **Persona 1: The Indie Hacker**

**Demographics/Firmographics**:

- 38-year-old male senior engineer at FAANG
- Uses MacBook M3 Max 48GB, iPhone 15 Pro
- Side projects: 3-4/year, 10-20 hrs/week
- Goals: Launch SaaS products, passive income

**Day-in-the-Life Scenario**:
*Alex spends 45 mins before work debugging his AI calendar tool. After a meeting-heavy workday, he has 30 mins to code but spends 20 mins reacquainting himself with context. His progress stalls due to fragmented time and mental exhaustion.*

**Current Solution \& Limitations**:

- **Tools**: VSCode + Copilot, Trello
- **Limitations**: No state preservation between sessions; disjointed CLI/iOS workflows; manual context reloading.

**Decision-Making Criteria**:

1. Zero-setup continuation after interruptions
2. iOS task tracking with build/test results
3. Automated context capture
4. Budget: ≤\$300 one-time

**Jobs-to-be-Done**:

- *Functional*: Reduce restart friction; track micro-progress.
- *Emotional*: Feel productive despite limited time; avoid project abandonment guilt.

---
#### **Persona 2: Open-Source Maintainer**

**Demographics/Firmographics**:

- 42-year-old non-binary staff engineer at fintech startup
- Maintains 5+ OSS projects; 20 PRs/week
- Uses DeepSeek-R1 32B via Ollama

**Day-in-the-Life Scenario**:
*Sam spends Saturday reviewing PRs. A critical bug in `libcurl` forces 3 hours of debugging, derailing their planned feature work. Context switches between projects cause errors.*

**Current Solution \& Limitations**:

- **Tools**: GitHub CLI, custom bash scripts
- **Limitations**: No cross-project context retention; manual triaging; no automated testing for contributions.

**Decision-Making Criteria**:

1. Automated PR/issue triaging
2. Project-specific memory
3. Multi-repo CI/CD
4. Budget: \$500 (expensable)

**Jobs-to-be-Done**:

- *Functional*: Reduce maintenance overhead; ensure contributor satisfaction.
- *Emotional*: Reclaim joy of creation; minimize OSS burnout.

---
#### **Persona 3: Tech Lead with Side Ventures**

**Demographics/Firmographics**:

- 45-year-old male CTO at Series A startup
- Manages 10 engineers; side project: AI compliance tool
- Uses Mistral 7B + local Kubernetes

**Day-in-the-Life Scenario**:
*Jamal codes during lunch but gets interrupted by production fires. Later, he finds his partial Stripe integration has syntax errors. Lack of session persistence forces full rework.*

**Current Solution \& Limitations**:

- **Tools**: JetBrains IDEs, Jira
- **Limitations**: No error prevention; no time estimation; disjointed deployment.

**Decision-Making Criteria**:

1. Architecture change alerts
2. Predictive time estimates
3. Single-command deployment
4. Budget: \$250 personal

**Jobs-to-be-Done**:

- *Functional*: Enforce consistency; prevent regressions.
- *Emotional*: Protect creative time; feel professional about side work.

### Rapid Concept Validation

**For Architect’s Lens**:

1. **Failed Similar Products**: CodeScene (poor Apple Silicon support); failed due to high latency.
2. **Market Timing**: 154% higher success when tech leaders involved early (BCG).
3. **Tech Maturity**: MLX-LM runs Qwen 32B at 18 tokens/sec on M3 Max.
4. **Early Adopters**: GitHub architecture review communities; React core team.
5. **Regulatory**: None (local processing).

**Validation Materials**:
**Landing Page Copy**:
> "See Your Code’s Architecture Live – Never Drift Off Spec Again
> - Real-time Mermaid.js diagrams
> - Change impact alerts
> - iOS/CLI sync
> Designed for senior engineers shipping complex systems. [Free Beta for M-Series Macs]"

**Value Prop Variations**:

1. "Catch design drift before it becomes tech debt"
2. "Your iOS companion for architecture reviews"
3. "Refactor with confidence using live dependency maps"
4. "The senior engineer’s visual co-pilot"
5. "From legacy code to clean architecture – visibly"

**Social Post**:
"Senior engineers: Tired of discovering architecture drift weeks late? I’m building a local AI agent that generates live Mermaid diagrams of your codebase and alerts on spec deviations. Curious? [Link]"

**Email Template**:
Subject: Does [Project Name] suffer from invisible architecture drift?
Body:
> Hi [Name],
> As a maintainer of [Repo], would a tool that:
> 1. Generates live architecture diagrams
> 2. Alerts on unintentional design changes
> 3. Works entirely on your M3 Mac
> ...help you avoid costly refactors? We’re building this. Open to your feedback!

**Survey**:

1. How often do you discover architecture drift post-merge? (Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly)
2. Rate the pain of late-stage refactors (1-10)
3. Would real-time diagrams reduce errors? (Y/N)
4. What’s your max budget for architecture tools? (\$0-50/50-150/150+)
5. Preferred output format: Mermaid/PlantUML/D2?
