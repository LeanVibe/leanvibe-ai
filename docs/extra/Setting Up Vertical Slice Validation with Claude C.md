# Setting Up Vertical Slice Validation with Claude Code CLI Commands

Setting up a comprehensive vertical slice validation system for your L3 coding agent requires a structured approach that validates the complete interaction flow from iOS mobile app to FastAPI backend [^1][^2]. This guide provides you with custom Claude Code CLI commands and a systematic validation framework to ensure your mobile-to-backend communication works reliably.

## Understanding Vertical Slice Validation Architecture

A vertical slice validation approach tests the complete user journey through all system layers, from the mobile interface down to the backend processing and back [^3]. For your L3 coding agent, this means validating four critical layers: iOS mobile app, WebSocket communication, FastAPI backend, and pydantic.ai agent processing [^4][^5].

The validation architecture ensures that each layer functions correctly both independently and in integration with other components [^6][^7]. This approach is essential for mobile applications where real-time communication and reliable state management are critical for user experience [^8][^9].

## Custom Claude Code CLI Commands for Validation

Claude Code CLI's custom slash commands provide an excellent foundation for creating reusable validation workflows [^2][^10]. These commands can be organized by scope and functionality to streamline your testing process.

The custom commands are organized into project-specific commands (`.claude/commands/`) and personal commands (`~/.claude/commands/`) [^2]. Project commands are shared with your team and focus on backend validation, mobile integration, API testing, and testing strategy [^10]. Personal commands handle development workflow tasks like debugging and quick health checks.

### Essential Validation Commands

Your validation toolkit should include commands for analyzing backend implementation, testing WebSocket connections, validating agent functionality, and debugging mobile integration issues [^1][^11]. Each command uses the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder to accept parameters, making them flexible for different testing scenarios [^10][^12].

For backend validation, commands like `/project:analyze-backend` and `/project:test-websocket` help ensure your FastAPI server and WebSocket endpoints are properly configured [^1]. Mobile integration commands such as `/project:ios-integration` and `/project:validate-flow` focus on testing the complete user journey from iOS app to backend [^4][^5].

## Step-by-Step Validation Setup

The validation process follows a structured approach that can be completed in under an hour. This quick setup ensures you can validate your system's core functionality before investing in full-scale development.

### Phase 1: Environment Setup

Begin by creating a dedicated validation workspace with proper directory structure for tests, custom commands, and validation scripts. Install the necessary dependencies including FastAPI, WebSocket libraries, and testing frameworks like pytest for Python and XCTest for iOS [^13][^14].

Set up your Python virtual environment and install the required packages: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `websockets`, `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and `pydantic-ai`. This ensures you have all the tools needed for comprehensive backend and WebSocket testing.

### Phase 2: Backend Validation Implementation

Create comprehensive test suites for your FastAPI backend, focusing on WebSocket connection establishment, message format validation, and agent processing [^13]. Your tests should cover both positive scenarios (successful connections and command execution) and negative scenarios (error handling and edge cases).

Implement health check endpoints and basic WebSocket connectivity tests using FastAPI's TestClient [^13]. These tests verify that your server starts correctly, accepts WebSocket connections, and responds to basic ping messages.

### Phase 3: WebSocket Communication Testing

WebSocket testing requires specialized tools and approaches due to its real-time, bidirectional nature [^15][^6]. Use multiple testing methods including Postman's WebSocket support, Python WebSocket clients, and custom validation scripts [^16][^17].

Postman's WebSocket testing capabilities allow you to create comprehensive test collections that validate connection establishment, authentication flows, message transmission, and error handling [^16][^17][^18]. Create collections that test basic connections, authenticated sessions, and command execution scenarios.

### Phase 4: iOS Integration Validation

iOS WebSocket testing requires special consideration for platform-specific networking behavior and SSL certificate validation [^19]. Create XCTest suites that verify WebSocket connections, message serialization/deserialization, and error recovery.

Test both connection establishment and message handling scenarios, ensuring your iOS app can successfully connect to the backend, send commands, and receive responses [^19]. Pay particular attention to authentication flows and session persistence across app lifecycle events.

## Automated Validation Workflow

Implement a comprehensive validation runner that executes all test phases automatically. This script should start your FastAPI server, run backend tests, execute WebSocket validation, and generate detailed reports of the results.

The validation workflow includes backend health checks, WebSocket connection testing, command execution validation, error handling verification, and performance baseline measurement. Create a shell script that orchestrates these tests and provides clear pass/fail feedback for each validation layer.

### Continuous Integration Setup

Integrate your validation tests into a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar platforms. Set up separate jobs for backend tests, iOS tests, and Postman collection execution, ensuring comprehensive validation on every code change [^7].

The CI pipeline should include automated testing for multiple scenarios: unit tests for individual components, integration tests for layer interactions, end-to-end tests for complete user journeys, and performance tests for acceptable response times.

## Performance Benchmarks and Success Criteria

Establish clear performance benchmarks for your vertical slice validation. Connection establishment should complete within 500ms, simple command execution within 2 seconds, and complex commands within 10 seconds.

Your validation is successful when all automated tests pass, iOS app connects and communicates effectively with the backend, the agent responds appropriately to commands, error handling works for common failure scenarios, and performance meets established benchmarks.

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

Use Claude Code CLI commands for systematic debugging of connection issues, server configuration problems, and iOS-specific networking challenges. Commands like `/project:debug-mobile` and `/user:debug-session` provide structured approaches to identifying and resolving issues.

Common troubleshooting scenarios include WebSocket handshake failures, authentication token issues, message format validation errors, and network connectivity problems [^15][^19]. Your custom commands should guide you through systematic diagnosis of these issues.

## Next Steps and Production Readiness

After successful vertical slice validation, implement comprehensive logging and monitoring, scale testing with load testing tools, conduct security audits of authentication and data handling, and perform user acceptance testing with real usage scenarios.

This validation approach ensures your L3 coding agent works reliably from mobile app to backend before investing in full-scale development. The systematic use of Claude Code CLI commands provides a repeatable, team-friendly approach to maintaining code quality and system reliability throughout your development process [^11][^10].
