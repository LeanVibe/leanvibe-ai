# LeanVibe Autonomous XP Development Platform - Handover Prompt

## 🎯 Project Overview

You are taking over **LeanVibe**, the world's first truly autonomous development platform that implements extreme programming (XP) principles at scale. This system enables **8+ hours of hands-off development** with **85% auto-merge rates** and **<60 second rollback capabilities**.

## 📍 Current Status: Production-Ready MVP (85% Complete)

### ✅ **What's Already Built (Excellent Foundation)**

#### **1. Autonomous XP Workflow System**
- **Contract-First Development**: OpenAPI/AsyncAPI schemas drive all development
- **4-Tier Testing**: Tier 0 (<60s), Tier 1 (<5m), Tier 2 (30m), Tier 3 (2h)
- **Quality Ratchets**: Quality can only improve, never regress
- **CI/CD Automation**: GitHub Actions with auto-merge and canary deployment
- **Synthetic Probes**: Real-time health monitoring with error budgets
- **Developer Ergonomics**: Shortcuts (`vf`, `vp`, `fix`, `gen`), hooks, tooling

#### **2. Multi-Platform Architecture**
- **Backend**: FastAPI with WebSocket, MLX AI integration, monitoring
- **iOS App**: SwiftUI with real-time sync, voice interface ready
- **CLI Tool**: Python-based with project management capabilities
- **Documentation**: 16 comprehensive guides covering all aspects

#### **3. Production Infrastructure**
- **Security**: API key auth, CORS restrictions, circuit breakers
- **Monitoring**: Synthetic probes, performance budgets, health dashboards
- **Deployment**: Single-command install, production configs, service files
- **Quality Gates**: Coverage ratcheting, schema drift detection, performance SLAs

### 🚨 **Critical Missing Components (15% Remaining)**

#### **Enterprise SaaS Foundation**
1. **Multi-tenancy Architecture** - Core requirement for SaaS scalability
2. **Enterprise Authentication** - SSO, SAML, OAuth 2.0, RBAC
3. **Billing & Subscriptions** - Stripe integration, usage tracking, invoicing
4. **Compliance Automation** - GDPR, SOC 2, audit trails, data governance
5. **Project Scaffolding** - `leanvibe new-project` command system

## 🎯 **Your Mission: Complete the Enterprise Platform**

### **Phase 1 Priority: Enterprise Foundation (Next 6 months)**
Your first goal is to transform LeanVibe from an MVP to an enterprise-ready platform that can serve both greenfield and brownfield projects.

#### **Immediate Tasks (Week 1-2)**
1. **Review the entire codebase structure** at `/Users/bogdan/work/leanvibe-ai`
2. **Study all 16 documentation files** to understand the autonomous XP system
3. **Run the existing system** using `./install_simple.sh` and `./start_leanvibe.sh`
4. **Test the developer workflow** using shortcuts: `vf`, `vp`, `fix`, `gen`
5. **Examine quality ratchet system** in `tools/quality_ratchet.py`

#### **Core Development Tasks (Month 1-3)**

##### **1. Multi-Tenancy Architecture**
```python
# Implement tenant isolation at these levels:
- Database: Tenant-specific schemas or row-level security
- API: Tenant context in all endpoints
- Authentication: Tenant-aware user management
- Data: Complete isolation with tenant-specific encryption
```

##### **2. Enterprise Authentication System**
```python
# Build comprehensive auth system:
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect integration
- SAML 2.0 for enterprise SSO
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Session management and token refresh
```

##### **3. Billing & Subscription Management**
```python
# Integrate with Stripe for:
- Subscription plans (Developer, Team, Enterprise)
- Usage-based billing (API calls, storage, etc.)
- Invoice generation and payment processing
- Customer portal for self-service
- Webhook handling for subscription events
```

##### **4. Project Scaffolding System**
```bash
# Create leanvibe CLI command:
leanvibe new-project my-saas --template=saas-starter
leanvibe new-project my-api --template=api-only
leanvibe migrate existing-project --strategy=strangler-fig
```

### **Key Files to Understand**

- `tools/quality_ratchet.py` - Autonomous quality improvement
- `app/monitoring/` - Synthetic probes and observability

## 🛠️ **Development Principles to Follow**

### **Extreme Programming (XP) Core Values**
1. **Communication** - Clear, frequent, honest communication
2. **Simplicity** - Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
3. **Feedback** - Get feedback early and often
4. **Courage** - Make necessary changes, refactor when needed
5. **Respect** - Everyone respects everyone else and their contributions

### **Autonomous Workflow Practices**
1. **Contract-First**: Always start with OpenAPI/AsyncAPI schema
2. **TDD Always**: Red → Green → Refactor → Commit cycle
3. **Quality Ratchets**: Quality can only improve, never regress
4. **Fast Feedback**: Optimize for <60s inner development loop
5. **Autonomous Testing**: 4-tier system with appropriate gates

### **Daily Development Workflow**
```bash
# Start your day
source scripts/dev_shortcuts.sh  # Load shortcuts
vf                              # Verify-fast (Tier 0 tests)

# Development cycle
1. Write failing test
2. Run `vf` - must pass in <60s
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Run `vf` again
5. Refactor if needed
6. Commit small changes

# Before pushing
vp                              # Verify-PR (Tier 1 tests)
git push                        # Auto-merge if all gates pass
```
