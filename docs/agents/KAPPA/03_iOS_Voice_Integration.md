# KAPPA Agent - Task 03: iOS Voice Integration Specialist

**Assignment Date**: Post Voice Interface Completion  
**Worktree**: `../leenvibe-ios-voice` → Switch to main iOS project  
**Branch**: `feature/ios-voice-interface` → Integrate to main  
**Status**: 🔄 ASSIGNED  

## Mission Brief

Outstanding work! You've delivered an exceptional voice interface system with "Hey LeenVibe" wake phrase detection and comprehensive speech recognition - 2 weeks ahead of schedule! Your 2,800+ lines of code represent a complete voice solution that's ready for integration.

## Context

- ✅ Your voice system is complete in `feature/ios-voice-interface` branch
- ✅ Dashboard Foundation has been integrated into main iOS project at `LeenVibe-iOS/`
- ✅ Backend APIs for voice commands are ready and waiting
- ❌ Missing: Integration of your voice system with the main dashboard

## Your New Mission

Integrate your complete voice interface system into the main iOS dashboard, creating a seamless voice-controlled project management experience.

## Working Directory Change

**From**: `../leenvibe-ios-voice` (feature branch)  
**To**: `/Users/bogdan/work/leanvibe-ai/LeenVibe-iOS/` (main integration)

## Integration Tasks

### 1. File Migration
Integrate your 8 voice files into main `LeenVibe-iOS/` structure:

**Your Voice Files to Migrate**:
```
From: feature/ios-voice-interface branch
├── Models/VoiceCommand.swift
├── Services/SpeechRecognitionService.swift  
├── Services/VoiceManager.swift
├── Services/VoicePermissionManager.swift
└── Views/Voice/
    ├── VoiceCommandView.swift
    ├── VoicePermissionSetupView.swift
    └── VoiceWaveformView.swift
```

**Integration Target**:
```
LeenVibe-iOS/LeenVibe/
├── Models/ (add VoiceCommand.swift)
├── Services/ (add 3 voice services)
└── Views/ (add Voice/ folder with 3 views)
```

### 2. Dashboard Integration
Connect voice commands to ProjectManager and dashboard actions:

**Voice-to-Dashboard Mapping**:
- "Hey LeenVibe, analyze project" → `projectManager.analyzeProject()`
- "refresh dashboard" → `projectManager.refreshProjects()`
- "show project details" → Navigate to ProjectDetailView
- "switch to agent chat" → Navigate to Agent tab
- "open settings" → Navigate to Settings tab

### 3. UI Integration Options

**Option A: 5th Tab** (Recommended)
```swift
TabView {
    // Existing 4 tabs
    VoiceCommandView(...)
        .tabItem {
            Label("Voice", systemImage: "mic.fill")
        }
        .tag(4)
}
```

**Option B: Floating Button**
```swift
ZStack {
    DashboardTabView()
    
    VStack {
        Spacer()
        HStack {
            Spacer()
            FloatingVoiceButton()
                .padding()
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. WebSocket Integration
Connect your voice commands to existing WebSocket service:

**Integration Points**:
- Route voice commands through `webSocketService.sendCommand()`
- Add voice command history to chat messages
- Real-time voice status indicators in dashboard
- Voice command confirmation in UI

### 5. Permission Flow Integration
Integrate microphone permissions with app onboarding:

**Integration Strategy**:
- Add voice permission request to first-run experience
- Voice features gracefully degrade without permissions
- Settings tab includes voice permission management
- Clear permission explanations and re-request flows

## Technical Integration

### Modified Files (Main Project)
```
LeenVibe-iOS/LeenVibe/
├── LeenVibeApp.swift              # Add voice imports
├── Views/
│   ├── DashboardTabView.swift     # Add voice tab or button
│   ├── ProjectDashboardView.swift # Add voice command integration
│   └── SettingsTabView.swift      # Add voice settings
└── Services/
    └── ProjectManager.swift       # Add voice command handlers
```

### New Voice Integration Points

**DashboardTabView Enhancement**:
```swift
struct DashboardTabView: View {
    @StateObject private var voiceManager = VoiceManager()
    
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            // Existing tabs...
            
            VoiceCommandView(
                voiceManager: voiceManager,
                projectManager: projectManager,
                webSocketService: webSocketService
            )
            .tabItem {
                Label("Voice", systemImage: "mic.fill")
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            voiceManager.configure(with: webSocketService)
        }
    }
}
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] "Hey LeenVibe" wake phrase works in dashboard
- [ ] Voice commands control project operations ("analyze project", "refresh dashboard")
- [ ] Voice interface accessible from dashboard (tab or floating button)
- [ ] Real-time voice status shows in dashboard UI
- [ ] Voice commands trigger WebSocket backend calls
- [ ] Microphone permissions integrated with app flow
- [ ] Voice system maintains battery efficiency
- [ ] All existing dashboard functionality preserved

## Performance Requirements

- **Integration Impact**: No degradation to existing dashboard performance
- **Voice Response Time**: <500ms wake phrase, <2s command processing
- **Memory Addition**: <30MB for voice system
- **Battery Impact**: <5% additional drain
- **UI Responsiveness**: 60fps maintained during voice operations

## Testing Integration

**Integration Test Scenarios**:
1. **Complete User Journey**: App launch → voice "analyze project" → dashboard update
2. **Cross-Tab Voice Control**: Voice commands work from any dashboard tab
3. **Permission Flow**: Voice permissions integrate with app onboarding
4. **Error Handling**: Voice failures don't break dashboard functionality
5. **Background Voice**: Wake phrase detection works when app backgrounded

## Quality Gates

- [ ] All voice files successfully integrated
- [ ] Dashboard navigation via voice commands working
- [ ] WebSocket integration for voice commands functional
- [ ] Microphone permissions properly integrated
- [ ] No regression in existing dashboard features
- [ ] Voice system performance targets met
- [ ] Complete integration testing passed

## Priority

**HIGH** - Voice is complete and waiting for integration. This completes the voice control pipeline that makes the iOS app unique.

## Expected Outcome

A seamlessly integrated voice-controlled dashboard where users can say "Hey LeenVibe" and control all project management functions, making the iOS app a truly hands-free development companion.
