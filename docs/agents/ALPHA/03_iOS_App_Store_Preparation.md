**Branch**: `feature/ios-production-ready`  
**Status**: üìã PREPARED (Assign after Task 2 completion)

## Mission Brief

Excellent work completing the iOS Dashboard Foundation AND Xcode project creation! You've built the core architecture and made it buildable. Now it's time to take the app from development to **App Store ready** - the final step toward production deployment.

## Context

- ‚úÖ Your Dashboard Foundation: Complete 4-tab iOS app architecture  
- ‚úÖ Your Xcode Project: Build system and dependencies configured
- ‚úÖ Team Integration: Voice, notifications, architecture viewer all integrating
- ‚è≥ **Final Phase**: App Store compliance, polish, and production deployment

## Your New Mission

Transform the LeanVibe iOS app from a development build into a **production-ready, App Store compliant application** with professional polish, proper metadata, and deployment infrastructure.

## Production Readiness Tasks

Voice Processing: <500ms wake phrase detection latency
```

**Code Quality & Stability**:
- Crash-free rate: >99.5%
- Memory leak detection and resolution
- Performance profiling with Instruments
- Network error handling and resilience
- Proper background/foreground state management

### 4. User Experience Polish
**Onboarding Experience**:
```swift
// First Launch Flow
1. Welcome screen with app overview
2. Voice permissions request with clear benefits
3. Backend connection setup and testing
4. Quick tutorial of main features
5. Dashboard with sample/tutorial content
```

**Accessibility Excellence**:
- VoiceOver support for all UI elements
- Dynamic Type support throughout the app
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Voice Control compatibility (iOS 13+)
- Assistive touch considerations

### 5. TestFlight Beta Distribution
**Beta Testing Setup**:
```
TestFlight Configuration:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Internal Testing (Development team)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ External Testing (Selected beta users)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Beta App Review submission
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Feedback collection and integration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Crash reporting and analytics setup
```

**Beta Feedback Integration**:
- Crash reporting via Xcode Organizer
- User feedback collection system
- Performance monitoring during beta
- Iterative improvements based on feedback

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Build Automation & CI/CD
**Xcode Cloud Integration**:
```yaml
# ci_build.yml
name: iOS Production Build
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    tags: ['v*']

steps:
  - name: Build and Test
    run: |
