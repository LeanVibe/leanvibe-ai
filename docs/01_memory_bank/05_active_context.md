# Active Context: LeanVibe

## 1. Current Sprint: 2.3 - Real-time Terminal Notifications

The primary objective of this sprint is to transform the CLI into a live, reactive monitoring and notification system.

### Key Deliverables:
*   **Background Notification Service**: Implement a non-blocking service to provide real-time terminal notifications that don't interrupt active commands.
*   **Desktop Notifications**: Integrate cross-platform desktop notifications for critical events like architectural violations or build failures.
*   **Live Dashboard**: Enhance the `monitor` command to act as a live metrics dashboard with notification overlays.
*   **Notification Management**: Implement features for viewing notification history and configuring notification preferences.

## 2. Major Backend Testing Infrastructure Complete ✅ (December 2024)

**Comprehensive Testing Implementation Achieved**:
- ✅ **PHASE 1**: Fixed critical test failures across ai_service_enhanced, ast_integration, and task_api_integration
- ✅ **PHASE 2**: Created comprehensive test suites for Task Management API, WebSocket Events, and Push Notification system
- ✅ **PHASE 3**: Implemented complete integration and performance testing with load testing, memory validation, and end-to-end workflows
- ✅ **Performance Validation**: All performance requirements met (response times, memory usage, throughput, error rates)
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 100+ test cases covering real-world scenarios, concurrency, error recovery, and system resilience
- ✅ **Memory Bank Updated**: Progress documentation reflects complete testing infrastructure achievement

**System Ready For**:
- Production deployment with validated performance characteristics
- High-load scenarios with proven concurrent user support
- Real-time development workflows with comprehensive monitoring
- Advanced feature development on solid, tested foundation

## 3. Recent Cleanup (January 2025)

**Technical Debt Addressed**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive `.gitignore` to prevent cache/build files from being tracked
- ✅ Moved integration tests from root to proper `tests/integration/` directory
- ✅ Consolidated iOS implementations - kept `LeanVibe-iOS` (with QR scanner) as canonical
- ✅ Archived older iOS implementations (`LeanVibe-iOS` and `LeanVibe-SwiftPM`) to `docs/archive/ios-implementations/`
- ✅ Moved single-use scripts to `docs/archive/single-use-scripts/`
- ✅ Cleaned up duplicate directories and cache files
- ✅ Removed outdated `requirements.txt` (project uses `pyproject.toml` with `uv`)

## 4. Upcoming Sprints Overview
