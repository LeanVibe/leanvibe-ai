## ðŸ”„ Agent Management Methodology

### Development Workflow

**Git Worktree Strategy**
```bash
# Agent worktree structure
leanvibe-ai/
â”œâ”€â”€ main/                    # Primary integration branch
â”œâ”€â”€ agent-alpha/            # iOS foundation development
â”œâ”€â”€ agent-beta/             # Backend enhancement work
â”œâ”€â”€ agent-delta/            # CLI enhancement work
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/            # Cross-agent integration testing
â””â”€â”€ archives/
    â”œâ”€â”€ agent-gamma/        # Completed: Architecture visualization
    â””â”€â”€ agent-kappa/        # Completed: Voice interface & testing
```

**Agent Onboarding Process**
1. **Specialized Context Creation**: Agent-specific CLAUDE.md with domain expertise
2. **Worktree Assignment**: Dedicated development environment with isolated changes
3. **Task Assignment**: Clear deliverables with success criteria and dependencies
4. **Integration Planning**: Defined handoff points and quality gates
5. **Documentation Standards**: Consistent commit messages and progress tracking

**Agent Coordination Protocol**
- **STATUS.md**: Central coordination and progress tracking
- **Cross-Agent Dependencies**: Well-defined integration points and interfaces
- **Quality Gates**: Build validation, test coverage, performance benchmarks
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive documentation for completed work

### Task Lifecycle Management

**Task States**
- **Assigned**: Task allocated to agent with clear specifications
- **In Progress**: Active development with regular progress updates
- **Review**: Implementation complete, awaiting integration validation
- **Integrated**: Successfully merged to main branch with tests passing
- **Archived**: Historical record of completed work

## ðŸ”§ Integration Architecture

### Cross-Agent Communication

**Interface Contracts**
```typescript
// Agent communication interface
interface AgentHandoff {
  sourceAgent: AgentType;
  targetAgent: AgentType;
  deliverables: Deliverable[];
  dependencies: Dependency[];
  qualityGates: QualityGate[];
  timeline: HandoffTimeline;
}

// Quality gate validation
interface QualityGate {
  criterion: string;
  validation: ValidationMethod;
  threshold: PerformanceThreshold;
  blocker: boolean;
}
```

**Integration Checkpoints**
- **Pre-Integration**: Build validation, test coverage verification
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-component compatibility validation
- **Post-Integration**: Performance impact assessment, regression testing
- **Production Readiness**: End-to-end workflow validation

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
