## üìù Context Preservation Notes

### Critical Information to Remember
1. **MLX-LM Integration Pattern**: The `asyncio.to_thread` pattern for model loading
2. **Segregated Testing Strategy**: Fast mocked vs slow real inference separation
3. **Service Decomposition Approach**: Strategy pattern for service consolidation
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Statistical analysis with P95/P99 tracking

### Files That Will Need Immediate Attention
1. `tests/test_task_api_comprehensive.py` - Depends on missing endpoints
2. `app/services/phi3_mini_service.py` - Core AI functionality
3. `app/agent/core_agent_orchestrator.py` - Service coordination
4. `pyproject.toml` - Test configuration and markers

### Key Decisions Made
1. Use MLX-LM for real inference with fallback to mock mode
2. Implement comprehensive testing before endpoint development
3. Prioritize performance benchmarking as first-class concern
4. Focus on service decomposition for maintainability

This task list provides a clear roadmap for continuing the work established in this session while maintaining the quality and performance standards achieved.
