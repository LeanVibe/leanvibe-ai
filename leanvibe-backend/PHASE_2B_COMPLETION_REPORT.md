## 🎯 Critical Integration Achievements

### 1. **Authentication API Integration** ✅ COMPLETED

**Achievement:** Successfully integrated authentication endpoints with main FastAPI application

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Added authentication router to main.py (`/api/v1/auth/*` routes)
- Fixed tenant context extraction from JWT tokens instead of dependency injection
- Resolved 404/400 errors in authentication flow
- Updated authentication endpoints to work seamlessly with existing architecture

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Authentication routes now properly registered
app.include_router(auth_router)  # Authentication and authorization endpoints

# JWT-based tenant context extraction
payload = await auth_service.verify_token(credentials.credentials)
tenant_id = UUID(payload["tenant_id"])
user = await auth_service.get_user_by_id(user_id, tenant_id)
```

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ Protected endpoints return 401 for unauthenticated requests
