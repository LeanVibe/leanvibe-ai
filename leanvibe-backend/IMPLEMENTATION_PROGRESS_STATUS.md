## **⏳ PENDING - WEEK 2 PRIORITIES**

### **🔒 API Endpoint Security Testing**
**Status**: ⏳ **PENDING** - Week 2 Priority 1  
**Scope**: 15+ API endpoints requiring security validation  
**Risk Level**: 🔴 Critical - Customer-facing  

**API Endpoints Identified**:
- Authentication: `/api/auth/*` (login, refresh, logout)
- Billing: `/api/billing/*` (subscriptions, payments, invoices)  
- Tenants: `/api/tenants/*` (CRUD, management)
- Projects: `/api/projects/*` (creation, access, collaboration)
- Tasks: `/api/tasks/*` (task management, assignment)
- AI/ML: `/api/code-completion/*`, `/api/cli-query/*`
- Monitoring: `/api/health/*`, `/api/monitoring/*`

**Required Security Testing**:
- JWT authentication on all endpoints
- Tenant isolation in API responses
- Input validation and SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting and CORS configuration
- Security headers and schema validation

### **💰 Complete Billing Service Testing**
**Status**: ⏳ **PENDING** - Week 2 Priority 1  
**Current Coverage**: ~30% (basic tests exist)  
**Risk Level**: 🔴 Critical - Revenue Impact  

**Required Implementation**:
- Stripe webhook signature validation and processing
- Subscription lifecycle management (create, upgrade, cancel, suspend)
- Usage-based billing calculations and quota enforcement
- Payment failure handling and retry logic
- Invoice generation, tax calculation, and compliance
- Revenue recognition and chargeback handling
