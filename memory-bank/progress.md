# Progress: LeenVibe

## 1. Current Status

The project is currently in **Sprint 2.3**, with a focus on enhancing the CLI experience. The foundational architecture is stable, and the project is progressing according to the established multi-sprint plan.

## 2. What Works (Completed)

*   **Foundational Architecture**: The core backend, CLI, and iOS components are implemented and integrated.
*   **Sprint 1**: The initial sprint, focused on foundational work, is complete.
*   **Backend Services**: The FastAPI backend is fully functional, including:
    *   AI service integration (`EnhancedAIService`).
    *   Session management.
    *   Event streaming via WebSockets.
    *   REST API for core operations.
*   **CLI Client**: The `click`-based CLI is operational and can communicate with the backend.
*   **iOS Monitor**: The SwiftUI-based iOS application successfully connects to the backend and displays real-time status.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Immediate Focus)

*   **Sprint 2.3 - CLI Notifications**: The primary task is to build and integrate the real-time terminal notification system. This involves:
    *   Connecting the CLI to the backend's event stream.
    *   Displaying notifications cleanly in the terminal using `rich`.
*   **Future Sprints (3-6)**: The broader project plan outlines five additional sprints to build out the full "enterprise-grade codebase analysis platform." The features for these sprints are defined in the project's `PLAN.md`.

## 4. Known Issues

*   There are currently no major blocking issues reported. The project is considered to be on track.
