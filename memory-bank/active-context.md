# Active Context: LeenVibe

## 1. Current Work Focus

The project is currently in **Sprint 2.3**.

### Sprint Goal:

The primary objective of the current sprint is to implement **real-time terminal notifications** for the LeenVibe CLI. This feature will leverage the existing event streaming service in the backend to provide users with immediate feedback and status updates.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   **Project Evolution**: The project has matured from its initial MVP specification into a more ambitious "enterprise-grade codebase analysis platform."
*   **Tech Stack Update**: The technology stack has been updated to better serve the project's new goals. Key changes include:
    *   **LLM**: `Qwen2.5-Coder-32B` (previously CodeLlama 13B)
    *   **Graph Database**: `Neo4j`
    *   **Agent Framework**: `Pydantic.ai`
*   **Architectural Principle**: The commitment to a **local-first** architecture remains a core principle.

## 3. Next Steps

*   Complete the implementation of the real-time notification feature as planned in Sprint 2.3.
*   Integrate the CLI with the backend's event streaming endpoint.
*   Design and implement the UI for displaying notifications in the terminal using the `rich` library.

## 4. Known Issues / Considerations

*   No major issues are currently reported. The foundational work and Sprint 1 are complete, and the project is proceeding as planned.
