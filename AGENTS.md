## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Backend Issues
**Primary Owner**: BETA Agent | **Contact**: Backend API Enhancement Specialist

**Common Problems & Solutions**
```bash
# ModuleNotFoundError or dependency issues
cd leanvibe-backend
uv sync                     # Reinstall all dependencies
uv pip list                 # Verify installed packages

# Port 8000 already in use
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9    # Kill existing processes
./start.sh                       # Restart backend

# AI model loading failures
# Check available disk space (models require ~250MB)
df -h
# Verify Apple MLX installation
python -c "import mlx; print(mlx.__version__)"

# Database connection issues
# Neo4j: Ensure Docker container is running or install locally
docker run -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 neo4j:latest
# ChromaDB: Embedded, should work automatically

# Performance issues
# Check system resources
htop                        # CPU/memory usage
# Verify M1/M2/M3 Apple Silicon
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType
```

**Advanced Debugging**
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
./start.sh

# Test API endpoints directly
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ai/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "test", "session_id": "debug"}'

# WebSocket connection testing
python scripts/test_websocket.py    # Custom WebSocket test script
```

### iOS Issues
**Primary Owner**: ALPHA Agent | **Contact**: iOS Dashboard Foundation Specialist

**Build & Runtime Problems**
```bash
# Build failures
# Clean build folder and derived data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/LeanVibe-*
# In Xcode: Product > Clean Build Folder
# Rebuild: Cmd+B

# Swift Package dependency issues
# In Xcode: File > Packages > Reset Package Caches
# Update packages: File > Packages > Update to Latest Package Versions

# iOS Simulator issues
xcrun simctl list devices           # List available simulators
xcrun simctl create "Test Device" com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-15-Pro
xcrun simctl boot "Test Device"     # Boot specific simulator

# Voice interface not working
# Check microphone permissions in iOS Settings
# Verify Speech Recognition permissions

## 🔄 Using Gemini CLI for Advanced Analysis

### When to Use Gemini CLI

**Large-Scale Analysis** (Recommended)
- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories that exceed context limits
- Comparing multiple large files for patterns or inconsistencies
- Understanding project-wide architecture or coding patterns
- Checking for specific patterns across the entire codebase

**Advanced Development Tasks**
```bash
# Comprehensive codebase analysis
gemini -p "@leanvibe-backend/ Analyze the entire backend codebase for architectural patterns, potential improvements, and technical debt"

# Cross-component integration analysis
gemini -p "@leanvibe-backend/ @leanvibe-ios/ @leanvibe-cli/ Analyze integration patterns between these three components and suggest improvements"

# Performance optimization recommendations
gemini -p "@leanvibe-backend/app/services/ Focus on performance bottlenecks in these service classes and recommend specific optimizations"

# Security analysis
gemini -p "@leanvibe-backend/app/api/ @leanvibe-backend/app/auth/ Perform security analysis of authentication and API endpoints"

# Testing strategy development
gemini -p "@leanvibe-backend/tests/ Analyze current test coverage and recommend comprehensive testing strategies for missing scenarios"
```

**Debugging and Problem Solving**
```bash
# Root cause analysis for failing tests
gemini -p "@leanvibe-backend/tests/ Analyze failing tests and provide root cause analysis with fix recommendations"

# Integration issue diagnosis
gemini -p "@leanvibe-backend/app/websocket/ @leanvibe-ios/LeanVibe/WebSocket/ Analyze WebSocket implementation across backend and iOS for potential connection issues"

# Performance regression investigation
gemini -p "@leanvibe-backend/app/ai/ Analyze AI service performance and identify potential bottlenecks or optimization opportunities"
```

### Gemini CLI Best Practices

**Effective Prompting**
- Use `@directory/` syntax to include entire directories
- Be specific about what you want analyzed or improved
- Ask for actionable recommendations with code examples
- Request both immediate fixes and long-term architectural improvements

**Workflow Integration**
```bash
# Before major refactoring
gemini -p "@component/ Analyze this component for refactoring opportunities and provide a step-by-step improvement plan"

# Code review preparation
gemini -p "@feature-branch/ Review this code for quality, performance, and integration concerns before merge"

# Architecture decision support
gemini -p "@entire-project/ Evaluate current architecture and recommend scalability improvements for production deployment"
```
